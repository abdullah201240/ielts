"In the future, more people will choose to go on holiday in their own country and not travel abroad on holiday. Do you agree or disagree?","Convenience of modern transportation shortens the distance between places and people embark on their travel more frequently than it has ever been, whether traveling domestically or aboard become another dilemma when people planning a trip. A short joy domestic travel seems optimistic for masses. However, exotic culture and various weather which travelling aboard offered will never been found in travel at home. It is disagreed that more people will choose to spending their holiday at home instead of abroad.

Compared with domestic traveling, oversea travel seems irreplaceable in terms of exotic culture experience which only available at the place of origin, for example, the folk music and operas will exclusively presented locally, such distinctive culture shows are barely found in domestic travel. Therefore, a home trip will not be a substitution of foreign traveling.

Apart from culture, the differences in weather will not be observed in a home travel, for instance, tropical weather drastically differs from dessert weather which result in diversification of plants and animals. Experience in various weather and environment undoubtedly brings brand-new recognition of the world, such recognition cannot be achieved easily in home traveling, thus traveling aboard will be the only option for those who travel to retain more recognition of the world.

In conclusion, the extraordinary culture experience and diversification of environment under various weather undeniably adding joy we have ever experience at home. For such reasons, it is crystal clear that travel abroad will remain trending and replacement of domestic traveling to travel abroad will not be realized.

"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Providing Internet access is just as important as other services, such as building roads, so governments should offer Internet access to all of their citizens at no cost.","Today, the Internet serves as our maps, our encyclopedias, and sometimes, our lifelines for social interactions, so the internet is crucial in shaping people's lives. I think the accessibility of the internet is vitally similar to other public utilities so the government should encourage people with free internet access. This step helps to improve educational services and employment opportunities.

In the first place, although public transportation aids in the commuting process, free internet enables people to increase their knowledge. Folks can utilize the facilities on the internet to pursue their dreams. For example, Cloie, one of my friends dropped out of college due to unaffordability, However, in Mexico government's experimental plan of giving the internet to the public gave her an opportunity to continue her studies online. She enrolled in the arts program in People College and attended classes online because of interrupted internet services, so if the internet services are free students like Cloie can get access to education with nominal fees.

In the second place, people will enhance their lives with better opportunities if they have the internet than infrastructure facilities. This means the internet contains an abundance of information regarding job postings and skills needed for acing interviews. For example, when I was in Jampet, our society was not equipped with facilities except roads. However, with crowd funding young people in my area provided free internet access to fellow people. As a result, many of the youth used internet for filling the job applications and learned skills from the internet. Thereby, they not only acquired skills for jobs but also participated in interview process. Thus, free internet provided our area people with better job placements and acquired skillsets for their careers. So, if government considered the plan of providing internet without any charge people would improve their lives with better possibilities.

In essence, I think government should provide free internet access for educational and employment purposes for enhancing people's lives, so I agree with the statement.",Yes,No,Yes,Yes,7
Children are getting 10% weight from past year.Give your causes and effects?,"It is often argued that in western society, the rate of overweight child has been increased around 20% in terms of 10 years. There are many causes and effects which would be discuss in following fragment.

The main causes and effects for overweight children is due to their food habitat and lack of physical exercise. Many children at present days like to eat junk food outside which is bad to our health. Due to this type of food intake their weight get increased rapidly in small age. Another problem is Physical exercise. children have latest technology like videogames, computer, Television which makes them lazy and make habits of involving into it hours to hours. Due to this activity many children are getting lazy and effecting their health and habitat.

To overcome with this problem, there are many solution to it. But some solution are Physical exercise and participating with friends. For induce, Instead of playing videogames inside the house. If children play outside with their friends then it help them to improve their habitat. Where as another factor for improving their health is sports, if children play sports which they find more interesting it will help them to be active and fit. Healthy food play vital role to children. Parents should prevent to children's not to eat junk food which is easily available in market place. They should provide nutrient food which makes them healthy.

Overall we can conclude that due to junk food and lack of physical activities our today generation is being lazy and inactive due to which it is effecting to their health and life. To overcome this effects, healthy food and sports helps them to be active and wealthy. If this activity is done to children then we can today generation children more beneficial in future.

"Scientists predict in the near future cars will be driven by computers, not people. Why? Do you think it is a positive or negative development?","In the upcoming years, cars and other vehicles are projected to be driven automatically by computers. From my perspective, this phenomenon brings more advantages than disadvantages.

First, there are several driving forces behind this forecast. Steadily increasing budget from the government and giant corporations has brought about groundbreaking advances in robotics technology. The last few decades have witnessed robots gradually takes over manufacturing jobs previously done by human. Soon enough, automation will become a ubiquitous presence in our daily life, handling a variety of tasks including driving. In addition, given that traffic accidents are on the rise, especially in densely populated cities, self-driving cars could be the answer to reduce fatalities. Simply by taking human emotions and errors out of the equation, autopilot mode could indeed save millions of lives from car crash incidence.

Having said that, the benefits of autonomous cars certainly outweigh the drawbacks. Operated with a high degree of precision, self-driving vehicles can greatly reduce average commuter times in metropolitan areas, offering many spin-off advantages from well-being to boosting the economy. Besides, with driverless cars able to access up-to-the-minute data to help monitor traffic, as well as digital maps and other tools, they could determine the fastest, most efficient route possible. All of this will result in less congestion, less time-consuming and fuel waste.

In short, growing level of automation in this modern era is inevitable. More specifically, the emergence of self-driving technology is around the corner and despite initial concerns, this should be perceived as a positive trend. ",Yes,No,Yes,No,6
The animal species are becoming extinct due to human activities on land and in sea. What are the reasons and solutions?,"It’s frightening that myriads of terrestrial and marine animals are on the verge of extinction due to human beings. My essay will shed light on the causes and measures to this issue.

To begin with, the constant tampering of nature by human has led to drastic changes in the natural world resulting in animals and plants finding it more difficult and difficult to survive. Nearly every kind of habitat or ecosystem - be it land, air or water - has been affected by the uncontrollable destruction of habitats by human. The impact of humans taking land for buildings, farming and timber has rendered species extinct at speeds unprecedented in Earth’s history. Besides, humans, due to their industrial, agricultural, or normal day-to-day activities, release an inordinate amount of toxic waste that is eventually dumped into the air, water or landfills. Tragedies like oil spills have been known to destroy and threaten many aquatic life forms.

Having said that, rapid, greatly intensified efforts to address the problem, slowing the extinctions currently underway. First, each government should levy exorbitant fines on devastating behaviors such as littering, illegal dumping or other environmental offences. The implementation of stringent laws, accompanied by extensive media coverage of the issue would raise environmental awareness among all sections of the society. Second, international organizations such as the United Nations should coordinate activities among member countries as well as encourage participation by the private sectorto promote sustainable use of the world’s natural resources. Specifically, the presence of such inter-governmental organizations plays a major role in initiating negotiations on reducing industrial pollution level or other toxic waste.

In short, the blame for the most recent mass extinction is not natural calamities - it’s human. Therefore, several solutions need to be done to tackle this worrying trend and save endangered species from the brink of extinction.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7
"some people think all lawbreakers should be put into prison, while others believe that there are better alternatives. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","We have witnessed many crimes in modern society. It is argued that all of the lawbreakers should be sent to jail, while others think that there are better alternative choices for lawbreakers to amend themselves. In my opinion, these statements are reasonable.

It is certainly true that lawbreakers should be taken into the prison for some reasons. One of the reasons is that this policy can to protect the inhabitants of cities. Lawbreakers usually commit crimes that will bring harms to the others such as stealing and robbing. By sending crime offenders to prisons, it can ensure that the society safety. As a result, citizens subsequently would feel that the society is peaceful and secured. Another reason is that this action reduce the crime rate. By strictly imposing punishment to criminals, it will decrease the level of crime rate because it has deterrent effects. Consequently, people would give up the thought of committing crimes.

However, there are opposing voices saying that there are better ways to solve this problem. To begin with, the government should offer jobs to criminals. Re-offenders, in most cases, are struggling with extremely limited income in their lives. Given secured jobs and reasonable payments, they naturally can learn some practical skills such as computer skills. Therefore, they will not risk their liberty because they live like ordinary residents with sufficient income. Apart from this, the government should provide free education to them. Due to leak of educating in the past, perpetrators were unable to judge what was right and wrong things to do. Being significantly educating, they will become good members and will not return to crime.",Yes,No,Yes,No,6
"Multicultural societies, in which there is a mixture of different ethnic peoples, bring more benefits than drawbacks to a country. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own experience or knowledge","Thanks to more widely open policies in economy and immigration of many countries, the 21st century has witnessed the surprisingly increasing formation of multicultural societies where a varying number of ethnic people stay together. Although it has both positive and negative effects to a country, it seems to me that we are more likely to obtain more benefits than disadvantages from this kind of society.

The more diverse the residents of a country are, the more cultural values they can share to enhance their awareness and knowledge of culture and tradition. People will get more directly engaged in understanding unique customs or rituals, life and work attitudes from their foreign neighbours, colleagues and friends. As a consequence, they enable to adapt the cultural diversity in order to develop their interpersonal skills and live closer to other cultures without having to live in person in another country.

Additionally, once people can know more about each other through everyday interactions at work or schools, the severe conflicts or even wars will be remarkably alleviated. It is undeniable that there might have some drawbacks that multicultural communities bring to a country. Racial disparity accelerated, the wealth-poverty gap deteriorated, different culture tensions are specific cases for what are the so-called drawbacks, but the inhabitants can overcome these when the government implement friendly-ethnic peoples’ policies, as well as the dwellers, have positive thoughts and behaviours to live compatibly with others.

Stimulating multiculturalism in a society will offer numerous advantages to a country rather than undesirable effects. Therefore, each individual should savour every rewarding moment of living in their multicultural community and proudly spread their unique traditions to international friends so as to increase the diversity.

Some people say that the only reason for learning reason for learning a foreign language is in order to travel to or work in a foreign country. Others say that these are not the only reasons why someone should learn a foreign language. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.,"There are a variety of reasons why people should learn a foreign language. Some people say that the only reason is to live or work overseas. On the other hand, others believe that there are many more reasons. In my opinion, travel and work abroad should not the only motives.

Undoubtedly, traveling and working overseas are the most common reasons for learning a new language. When people decide to work and settle away from their countries, there are many struggles, and one of them is cultural barriers. However, knowing the native language can help newcomers overcome the problems easier. Besides that, partially or fully understand the local language can make travelers enjoy their trips more. On the other hand, , because there are more and more unemployed workers, employers also have higher expectations, and knowing (that) another language would be a great advantage. In short, knowing another language is necessary for jobs and travel abroad.

On the other hand, , there are other benefits of knowing a foreign. Some studies show that the brains of bilinguals think and work differently from normal ones. Bilinguals can take in information, and they process it more complex and diverse. As a result, knowing a new language broaden our mind. We can think from various perspectives, and we will know more about the world around us.

In conclusion, in my opinion, knowing a foreign language can help us in jobs and travel. However, besides that, there are many benefits and reasons why we should learn a new language.

1. Newspapers and books are outdated. Why do some people believe this? What is your opinion?,"The twenty-first century illustrates an increasing number of people are relying on new forms of technology. A possible consequence of this is that traditional media such as books and newspapers are not common, and these documents are considered to be outdated. Personally, I disagree with this point of view, books and newspapers should be a basic way of saving knowledge and traditional culture.

The principal reason that some people give this view is discovering information in the global from the internet or multimedia such as television, podcast channel is much quicker and easier. For instance, if people use Google or another search engine, they can instantly get the latest news. The fact that technology gives more convenience in browsing information, but most of these are the fast-moving news, and when an individual wants to research or directly interact with the words, in reality, the traditional platform such as research reports, academic notebooks are more essential than the high-technical platform.

Furthermore, reading print books and newspapers can be better for the brain and health. Because readers of print books absorb and remember more of the plot than readers of e-books or digital magazines. For example, many jobs require people to stare at a computer screen all day, and it will give their eyes a break. Electronic books can cause screen fatigue, which may lead to blurred vision, dryness, and irritation, with print books, those problems do not occur any more. In addition, researchers believe that if readers have a books or personal library at home, they will be more likely to link to higher academic achievement.

E-books and internet platforms would be more convenient than traditional books. But the important thing is reading on paper books can enrich the entire experience, and readers will not be got sidetracked more easily than digital readers. Thus, traditional reading will not be outdated. ",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7
Depression and anxiety disorders among Adults,"Nowadays, the most of Adults constantly face with the stress, problems in their business life, private life. All of these worsen them morally and cause depression, anxiety, social phobia which completely frustrate their mental health and the foremost their life.

On one hand, from my point of view, Adults are charge of so many responsibilities such as about their children’s future, job, family affairs, meeting their child’s needs, etc. and each of them causes stress on middle-aged people. That is way disorders as depression and anxiety usually occur on Adults. In my opinion, it is mainly bound up business life that they spare the most of their day in there. Actually this depends on the type of work. Some jobs may be so stressful, for instance, profession of a doctor. Saving someone’s life requires too much responsibility and self-sacrifice and from my stand point, such as professions results anxiety. However place of doctors is undeniable in our life.

On another hand, one of liability of Adults is about their children. They have to meet their needs as affording their education, buying them necessary things and sometimes they think more and more deeply about it. They consider that what if I am laid off, cannot meet my child’s significant needs. Hence, All of these thoughts make them depressed and create uneasiness on them.

To sum up, What they need is to chill out, think less and occasionally walking away from responsibilities. Unless they do it, they will deal with diverse illnesses, due to it is evident fact that depression and anxiety create harmful diseases like cancer. ",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7
"Write about the following topic: In the past, most people lived in small villages where everyone knew everyone else. Nowadays, most people live in large cities where they only know a few people in their area. What do you think were the advantages and disadvantages of living in a small community? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge and experience.","In the past, we lived in small communities, small villages and nowadays we are living in a big communities, large cities. But let's focus on the past, what was the advantages and disadvantages of a living in a small communities.

I think advantages of living in a small communities was people didn't feel awkward with each other because they were close. If any of family in the village had a emergency problem, they can called help from other quickly because there house were against to each other,

About the disadvantages of living in a small villages was they got bored of their neighboor and people surrounded them because they were too similar. They didn't get a choice to communicate with new people outside their area so their social communication skill was limited. They didn't have many new friends.

In my opinion, living in a small villages let you to live close to your family and friends. But, you can just live like that, I love to experience new things and communicate with different people. Living in a big city is appropriate for me.",Yes,No,Yes,No,6
Major environmental problem,"Many people think that the loss of particular plants and animal species is the major environmental problem that humans are facing nowadays, while others believe that some environmental issues are more alarming. I agree with the latter view and will analyze both views in the following essay.

On the one hand, the loss of animal and plant species is considered a main environmental problem because of its impact on our planet’s biodiversity. Around the world, trees are being cut down for industrial and agricultural purposes. As a result, there will not be enough trees to produce oxygen for humans and prevent the soil from washing away. Meanwhile, endangered animals are being poached to serve people’s needs, hence negatively affecting the whole ecosystem. For example, when sharks are killed for their fins, many types of aquatic species no longer have their natural predators to control their population. Consequently, the disappearance of predators disrupts the natural food chain and then leads to unbalanced underwater ecosystems.

On the other hand, there are more urgent environmental issues that exist aside from the loss of plant and animal species. Those problems including pollution and climate change are the main factors that cause the loss of biodiversity and put the natural habitat on the brink of destruction. Water and soil pollution caused by industrial and agricultural activities are poisoning a large number of species of marine and land animals, which means that human health is also negatively affected as those animals are humans’ important food source. Moreover, changing weather patterns caused by climate change lead to more frequent occurrences of natural disasters such as droughts, floods, and wildfires.

In conclusion, the loss of particular plants and animals should indeed be paid great attention to, but other environmental issues should also be taken into consideration. I think we should put a great deal of effort into tackling all of those problems rather than only focusing on the animals and plants’ extinction.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7
Individuals can do nothing to improve the environment; only governments and large companies can make a difference.,"Many people say that there is no need for any individual to help for the improvement of the environment because they believe that it only depends on the performance of the government and huge companies. I totally disagree to this idea. I believe that every individual is important through participating and encouraging awareness to all.

Everyone is essential. Any good plans for the betterment of the environment has to be started by an individual. The goal will only be achieve if every part of the community will participate. For example, the government had announce about the global warming prevention and tips on how to do it, they need the participation of every individual so that the goal may be accomplish, because if people will only hear about it without any action from them, the goal will not be met.

Also, any individual can be an instrument to encourage awareness to all that they will encounter. If anyone had been intentionally doing his/her part for the project, the outcome will be positive. One good example is being member of a family, let us say that the mother heard about the project of the government to save the earth by starting from segregating garbage in different ways which are garbage, recycling and compost. The mom can be a good encourager by first doing it by herself, then next is to teach her husband and kids to do it as well. This is a good contribution to the government's project that may lead to a positive outcome.

In conclusion, every individual is essential for the goal of improving the environment. If there is no individual involvement, success in achieving the goal is impossible. ",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7
"The first man to walk on the moon claimed it was a step forward for mankind. However, it has made little difference in most people’s lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","*Discovering the space is a great invention for human beings. Nevertheless it has had few effects in lifestyles.

"Some people think that the government should provide assistance to all kinds of artists including painters, musicians and poets. However, other people think that this is a waste of money. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Many people lives are richer because of their art which they express to community. Many individual believe that the government should provide funds to artist while other believe that it is unfair. This essay analyse both the perspectives.

To begin with former views, there are many points that authority should help artists. Artists are contribute to nation by their art. Creativity is having in every person by their born but to elaborate it is a vital thing for any individual and all artist do that. At the end, they serve their creativity to their community for entertain perpose. Additionally, artist represent their culture by their art so, they become ambassador of their nation. For an example, painters represent their art by emboss as well as sculpture represent by carving and engraving and could be popular worldwide and express their tradition.

Moving to a latter view counter of former view having a strong reasons. Government should firstly focus on basic need for developing country. Individual's primary need is accommodation shelter and food yet, many individual has not get it. For well being life of human is a foremost priority for authority and still thye focus on other art instead this primary things. Additionally, they should also focus on infrastructure development. Nation want to add their name in developed country, foremost of it is developed their urban, ruler and their transportation by providing more found in it.

Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Equality between men and women has always been an issue in societies all around the world. Some believe that universities ought to consent to equal numbers of male and female students in all subjects. However, I disagree on this issue that the capacity of each subject should be equal for men and women students due to the lack of practicality and fairness.

The first reason that the numbers of male and female students accepted by universities should not be equal in every subject is that it will definitely be impractical. since some subjects are not appropriate and also not popular for both genders, the opportunity for students of one gender in a specific subject might be eliminated. For an instance, some subjects such as nursing, clothes designing, and interior designing are more popular among female students whereas some other subjects such as civil engineering and mechanics are more desirable for male students. In addition, job opportunities may be influenced by this issue. If there was a shortage of male mechanics, some of the subject-related projects would not be carried out.

Another good reason for inequality in the numbers of male and female students in all university subjects can be the fact that it will not be fair. Some meritorious students may lose their chance to be accepted in the particular subject if the capacity of the course is divided equally, which is frustrating for students. So, I believe that the numbers of seats for each subject should not be based on the gender.

In conclusion, universities ought not to accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject due to being practical and fair. The capacity of each subject had better be based on merit not gender. ",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,6
"As most people spend a major of their adult life at work, job satisfaction is an important element of individual wellbeing. What factors contribute to job satisfaction? How realistic is the expectation of job satisfaction for all workers?","Undoubtedly, a full-time job has always been an integral part of most people’s lives. Since it is said that majority of the adult life is dedicated to working, job satisfaction is a significant element in people’s health and happiness. There are several factors which can lead to job satisfaction. However, I believe the expectation that all people can be satisfied with their working condition and get full enjoyment is unrealistic.

There are several factors which can result in job satisfaction. Firstly, workers’ interests might be influential in enjoying the work they carry out. In my opinion, the stronger interests people have in their job, the higher motivation they get to take on the work and do it properly. Another effective factor can be the sense of fulfillment workers feel after work completion and getting promotion. When they monitor their progress day by day, for example, they get motivated and it may lead to higher sense of responsibility they develop. Besides, they become good team players and can co-operate with others well. The last but not least, the amount of money people gain as the salary can play an important role in job satisfaction. When people get more money in a fulfilling job, they get encouraged to carry out their work with the sense of happiness and satisfaction.

Of course, all people in a society are not expected to enjoy their working conditions. Sometimes, the need for money forces people to find a permanent job regardless of their interests. For instance, due to the rising inflation in my country, people have to find a well-paid job or work overtime just for gaining money. They have to overwork, therefore, to make a living and there sometimes seems to be no balance between their work and life and they cannot spend their time with their family members and friends and enjoy their lives; which may lead to physical or mental health problems.

In conclusion, even though there are a lot of factors such as people’s interests, stimulating working conditions, and income which cause job satisfaction, it is unrealistic expectation that all workers are likely to be satisfied and content with their jobs.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7
Having a good university degree guarantees people a good job. To what extent do you agree?,"According to the datum that we are living in the revolutionized world. Some people argue that when they have a university degree they have a good job opportunities. Personally, I cannot entirely agree with the statement that university degree guarantees people a good job. I think the only qualification is not required to secure a job; many other things are also necessary. So I will discuss my point of view for this issue.

First and foremost, I would like to point out that sometimes qualified person fail to get employment while others get the job who haven’t a proper degree. Referring to this situation, I can easily say that a university degree provides people with a theoretical information about their professions. But practical training makes people more confident and experienced when they face challenges in working environment. For example, Suppose that there are 2 candidates, one of them has graduated from university in this year and the other does not have a university degree, but he has experience. In extreme cases, there will be an experienced person hired.

On the other hand, one of the major factor is communication skills, confidence and critical thinking. People who are graduated from university but he or she doesn’t have enough communication skills or critical thinking about their qualifications they can’t get the good employment opportunities among the competitors. Because they will fail when they try to explain datum or ideas for company. By the way it is transparent that Employers always analyze their employees about how they solve the problems?

To sum up, having a university degree will put you ahead in this competitive environment, but just having it doesn't guarantee people a good job. According to my perception, both university degrees and practical knowledge are equally important. ",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7
".Nowadays animal experiments are widely used to develop new medicines and to test the safety of other products. Some people argue that these experiments should be banned because it is morally wrong to cause animals to suffer, while others are in favour of them because of their benefits to humanity. Discuss both views.","Regarding to the datum that animal testing has important role of advancement of medicine and experimentation of other harvests. While other people argue that we have no moral right to utilize animals for our own purposes and these actions should be banned.

People want to protect and cure illnesses with high quality medicines. Long-term tests should be performed to prepare high quality medical treatments and people use animals for experimentation. But the transparent ideas of those who are support for banned animal testing is these medicines may have some unknown side effects. Because it is obvious that our human body not same with animals. According to these arguments people think that they can use or improve alternative non-animal testing methods. Afterwards they can protects animal rights and prevent their existence.

But some people support using animals in any medical research or testing products. Today a large number of people recover from their illnesses by powerful medical treatments. These discoveries are impossible without experimentation on animals. Moreover, it is help to enable the safety of medicines and products before utilizing by humans. Scientist need to know all effects of drugs on animals in order to discovering new medicines or developed any treatment. Without animal experimentation we can discover few types of medicines doing alternative methods.

In conclusion, animal testing can only use for very important issues such as cure of cancer or vaccination of COVID-19 not for cosmetic industry or entertainment products. I agree that these tests can hurt them but it is beneficiary for human being.",Yes,No,Yes,No,6
It is generally accepted that families are not as close as they used to be. Give some reasons why this change has happened and suggest how families could be brought closer together.,"Nowadays, people’s lifestyle has changed in comparison to the past and family members are not as close as they used to be for several reasons such as the economic issues and the growth of technology. Despite the fact that some would argue that this problem will correct itself overtime, in my view, there is much that can be done to address this problem constructively.

The first reason that families are far from each other these days can be the staggering costs of life which enforce almost all family members to work hard even overtime to provide money and amenities for the family. The rising inflation rate affects all parts of people’s lives and living expenses such as accommodation, either purchasing or renting, eating products, clothes, and other necessities. People, therefore, have to overwork and they cannot find free time spending with their family members in relief. Besides, by the growth of technology, most people tend to spend their time talking to their friends on social media or surfing the internet. So, this keeps people amused and away from their families.

One possible approach would be the government efforts and negotiations in order to hinder the day by day increase in prices; especially the price of dollar which has the significant and direct impact on people’s lives. This would certainly tackle the problem. However, measures like this would be considered as excessive and difficult to be done quickly. A more feasible approach would be time-management in using technology by family members. For instance, family members are to spend their time together after work rather than spending their time on social media or playing games on their gadgets.

In conclusion, it is true that this problem will probably not be solved quickly. However, that is not the reason to avoid taking actions. If the government and people take appropriate actions in this case, this problem will definitely be solved overtime and families could be brought closer together again, I suppose.",Yes,No,Yes,No,6
The idea of having single career option is becoming old fashioned one. The new fashion mil be to have several career or way of earning money and further education will be something that continuous throughout life.,"The perception of having only single career becomes outdated now. The new goal is to have numerous career option to generate passive income and to implement life long learning.

I am very truly agreed with the above mentioned statement. Because today's world demands to be entrepreneur. As the old method to study and getting jobs doesn't works anymore. For example if a student is studying in the stream of business. He prefers to generate passive income from number of sources, as internet provides a lot of opportunities to earn without doing a lot of hustle bustle.

On the hand it is necessary to have two or more career options because sometimes you are unable to earn that much from a single source to fulfill your desires. Also the modern world has lot of opportunities but difficulties to. And if a person is depends upon a single career and he or she if loses his job, then this might be impossible from him to survive for longer period of times.

Therefore the shop keeper has to use his critical thinking skills and sell it's products with ease by converting his shop to grocery store which will relax him and his customers too.

Essay topic: Some people think that school children need to learn practical skills such as car maintenance and bank account management along with the academic subject school. To what extend do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays the students are learning many things within a school lesson. They are learning mostly about some theoretical skills such as history, math and chemistry. But some people think that the students should be taught more about practical skills that will help them to survive when they grow up such us car maintenance and bank account management. In my opinion both views are equally important.

To begin with, more practical skills will help youngsters to face many problems. To be more specific, those skills are something very useful as they will help them to live more easily and face every daily difficulty that might show up during their life. For example, if the students learn how to manage their bank account they will make purchases and they will never face a financial problem. Also another significant practical skill is the car maintenance. For example they will be helped a lot as they will have the knowledge on how to react if they stuck in the middle of nowhere.

But, except from the practical skills the students should teach theoretical subjects to broaden their horizons. Subjects such as chemistry and biology are extremely important for a doctor as he cannot diagnose a disease without that. Additionally, philosophy and history are important for a teacher so that he can teach his knowledge to the next generations. What I mean is that the theoretical skills that the youngsters learn in school is significant because those subjects are that will help them understand the practical skills and then they can combine all the knowledge they have and live a nice life.

To sum up some people believe that the students have to learn except from the academics subjects some practical skills. Personally I think that practical skills should be taught in school as long as the teachers do not limit the theoretical subjects.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7

"Essay topic: When people move to a new country, they often face a difficult choice between maintaining their own customs and adopting customs of the country they moved to. In your opinion, which is better??Give specifics details and reasons to support your viewpoint.","More and more people today move to a new country in order to have an easiest life but the face a problem there. They cannot decide if they will maintain the customs that they had in the previous country or if they will adopt new ones. In my opinion, they should choose the first view for many reasons that will be examined below.

First of all, every person who leaves from a country and moves to another one usually misses the land they used to live before. To be more specific, maintain the customs of the country that you used to live, help you as it reminds you this country. For example some customs are related with some holidays. There are hundredths holidays but not all of them are celebrated to all the countries. This means that somebody can celebrate a holiday that it is not used to celebrate in this country in order to remind him how nice he lived there.

First of all, many customs nowadays were lost because no one was care about their maintenance. What I mean is that if everyone who moves on a different country adopts new customs and forget about the old ones the latest will be disappeared. Additionally, by preserving the customs you honor your fatherland. Extensively, with this act of kindness you will be a good example for those who have moved before as you can show them that you should never forget about your fatherland.

To sum up, people who relocate they have a doubt if they have should preserve their own customs or they should adopt new ones. In my opinion I consider that those people should appreciate and love the country that they live now but they must not forget about their father land. ",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7
Many people continue to use cars and motorcycles even though they know that they are bad for the environment. Whilst this? What can be done to reduce the use of these vehicles?,"Nowadays it has been observed that using cars or motorcycles are more common among people for commuting. Although many of them are aware of the harmful effect of it gives to the environment no one really tends to make certain changes. In this essay the reasons for the usage of cars and motorcycles and possible solutions for resolving the issue will be discussed.

There are several causes of utilizing vehicles which includes time-saving and convenience. Regarding to time-saving it is obvious that cars consume less time rather than public transport. In other words, when people use cars they do not need to waste their time on waiting as others do for public transport. Convenience is also another major benefit of vehicle usage. Individuals can travel to any point at any time without wasting time.

On the other hand all kinds of transportations have its negative effects on the environment. Because of the release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases there seems to be an increase in the level of global warming. To resolve this issue the engineers have offered several methods. One of these include switching to electric cars. These types of cars reduce the amount of carbon emission by using electric. Moreover electricity is a renewable resource whereas gasoline is not. Also gasoline is way more expensive than the electricity. Therefore switching to electric vehicles would be benefit both environment and individuals.

In conclusion, it is still possible to use vehicles without harming the environment. Therefore people should be encouraged to switch to the new method of using them.",Yes,No,Yes,Yes,7
"In most cultures,people are taught to respect the elderly. Is it important to respect the elderly? How does one demonstrate respect to the elderly?Be specific and give concrete response","In a big number of countries, the majority of people are taught to show respect to the older generations. This is something really significant and can be shown in a lot of ways some of which are going to be mentioned below. To begin with, respecting the elderly it is of a high importance because are the ones who raised and educated us. This means that they already have sacrified a lot in order for us to become successful adults and one of the minimal things that we could do is appreciate them. Besides this we need to maintain this kind of behaviour around them because they always were beside us during difficult times so we can feel at ease again and get a hold of ourselves. No matter how you see it they have done a great deal of things for us so respecting them is a must. Obviously, there are a lot of ways to show your respect one of which is to help them do things they are not able to do anymore like lifting heavy objects. We could also provide them with food and medicine when nessecery just like they did it for us when we were young to show them that we appreciate what they have done through all these years. And last but not least is to make sure when we don't see them to call them so they can feel loved and that there are people that care for them. In conclusion, respecting elderly should be a characteristic of every young persons personality for a lot of reasons and there plenty ways to accomplish this. Fortunately, this kind of behaviour is being adopted by more and more individuals leading to a reassuring future.",Yes,No,Yes,No,6
"In most cultures, people are taught to respect the elderly. Is it important to respect the elderly? How does one demonstrate respect to the elderly?Be specific and give concrete response","It is a pretty well known fact, that in the majority of countries people show respect to the elderly ones. This gesture shows good behavior and discipline. In my opinion it is very important to demonstrate respect to the elderly people for many reasons, which many of them will be examined below.

To start with, in my country Greece the demonstration of respect to the old people is something that someone can be find in every family and in every person’s principals, with very little exceptions. We believe that this is very important for them because as time goes by they get older and they feel more lonely and disappointed, so what we have to do is to show them our love and appreciation. Moreover, it is a usual phenomenon that when the parents are in work they call their kids’ grandparents to keep an eye on them until they come back. I believe that this is a very serious reason to respect our grandparents and generally the elderly people

There are many ways to show our respect to an old person. In case he is a relative of us, we can show our respect and love by giving him a kiss or call him for a dinner. Furthermore, a good option is to buy him a gift that he was always wanted. Also if we see someone old enough who cannot pass the driveway, it will be great for him to help him pass easy and safe. Last but not least we should avoid talking to them baldly and not paying attention to them because they feel sad something that is very bad for an old person.

To end up I deeply believe that we must show respect and have time with the elderly people because they deserve it and that will make happy not only us but the old person too. ",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7
1.The availability of cheap air travel is giving more and more ordinary people the opportunity to travel worldwide. Environmentalists claim that this is leading to global warming. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Write at least 250 words.,"Traditionally it is believed worthwhile keeping certain old buildings. For example, many castles around the world are of great historical interest, because they symbolize a specific epoch. Besides, it is claimed that older constructions need to be kept for nostalgic reasons, as they are evocative of another era like 19 century wooden houses in the central part of Moscow.

Although I understand the arguments about saving certain buildings as a national heritage, I cannot fully agree with them. In my opinion, some older structures are overrated and a lot of money is spent on maintaining them. In contrast, new buildings are generally cheaper to build and to take care of. It means that it is more economical for a city budget to replace older buildings with modern ones. For instance, on Myastitskaya street in Moscow almost all 19 century houses more demolished and contemporary office buildings were erected.

Another reason why modern structures seem more reasonable to me is that older buildings are not practical to work and live in. For example, instead of cramped rooms and low ceilings in 19 century buildings there could be specious and airy apartments with huge glass walls instead of windows. In other words, the living standard may be drastically improved in some urban residential areas.

To sum up, this subject is rather controversial, but I strongly believe that the construction of modern buildings is more worthwhile than maintain older ones. From my standpoint, it is economically viable and sensible.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7
Advertisements are everywhere affecting our lives. Discuss the subject,"Nowadays, it is a well known fact that advertisements are gaining more and more popularity among the world. In this point proponents of this view claim that ads do not affect people’s lives while competitors believe that people are being affected by ads. In my view people can be easily affected By ads for various reasons.

To begin with, people especially youngsters are being all the more exposed to ads that showing off a glamorous and luxurious lifestyle which is a far cry from reality. However, people are perpetually compare themselves with this glamorous lifestyle and they end up feeling worthless and suffering from mental disorders, such as depression. Additionally, ads showcase distorted images of beauty. This practice not only underestimate the roles and personality of the two genders, but also lead young people to eating disorders in order to reach these standards and even to suicidal tendencies.

Secondly, it is undeniable that media play a main role in our lives as we are unable to escape from them. For instance are not constrained only in television but also in radio, in our mobile phones and in digital hoards and posters on streets. This means that we are being exposed to implicit and explicit messages in every aspect of our live. What is more by the constant brainwash from media we are treated as potential Byers and thus can turn a person into over consumer who is being obsessed with material world with lack of critical thinking.

Taking everything into account, social media influence people’s lives a great deal. It is vital so that people try to resist against these messages and become critical thinking",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7
"The government should ban smoking in all public places, even though this would restrict some other people's freedoms. Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answer.","Smoking in public areas is something that we have all seen. What would happen if this was to be banned? In this essay I am going to discuss few positives and negatives of this. First let us look at the benefits this is going to have. Looking at it from the social angle, the non-smoking population which includes children outnumbers the smoking population and hence majority of the people would be happy and in support of this. Smoking not only affects the health of the person who smokes, but also of the people around that person who breathe that air. Hence, banning smoking in all the public areas would save many non-smokers from this situation. Moreover, young kids are very observant and tend to pick up habits from older people around them. Exposing them to smoking at such young age might make them think that it is normal and not wrong, which inturn might lead them to trying it themselves. However, by banning smoking in public areas we can avoid this. But this also has some negetives. Due to the restriction imposed on smoking in public areas, most of the places like theatres, restaurants, malls etc have the threat of becoming less customer-friendly which inturn might result in widespread economic loss. Moreover, some people say that considering the technological advancements of the present day, children have access to almost everything on the internet and smoking is not something new to them. Hence, banning it in public areas would not bring the difference most of us are expecting. In conclusion, I would like to say that banning smoking from all public spaces might not be the best idea. Instead, every public space should have some smoking zones where people can smoke. By doing so, we are not taking away the freedom of such people and the same time making the public areas less polluted and children-friendly. ",Yes,No,Yes,No,6
Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The topic on whether or not universities must accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject is deemed a pivotal question in gender and development studies. Discussions and arguments on equal representation and how we can account the representation of women has been increasing through time, especially movements on equality is becoming more and more mainstreamed around the world.

Indeed, there is a huge improvement and small but noticeable victories on the part of advocates who strive to place women on the decision-making table in a variety of fields. One of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals is to achieve gender equality through its integration in all development plans, policies, programs, and activities. And such is fitting to be applied into the academe as female representation will produce a more enriching, diverse, and dynamic discussions in every subject. Of course, one must take into consideration that there is still the ""freedom of choice"" by every individual to take part in a subject he/she may find interesting, but universities must open themselves and take a more encouraging approach to harness inclusivity.

In a rapidly developing world, I agree and support universities who are now taking the path towards equal gender representation to achieve the balance of perspectives among men and women. Doing so will lessen outdated biases, will broaden more minds to seemingly minor issues and concerns that require further deliberation, and empower more women to speak with confidence based on their experiences and how they are forming and formed by their culture and community. Addressing underrepresentation would tell us that academic institutions are on the right direction in serving their purpose and preserving their integrity. ",Yes,No,Yes,No,6
Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taugh to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.,"Encouraging a sense of competition in children have its own advantages and disadvantages. The first time they develop this is when they engage in games, and their reactions upon receiving a win or a loss should be closely monitored by the parents. For example, being the winner may be a positive reinforcement to boost their drive to accomplish something again, or it may also make them complacent and too proud. On the other hand, losing in a particular child’s play may harness feelings of inadequacy and injure their self-worth, or it may be a definite reason to try harder and get better next time. The surrounding adults, especially the parents, have a pivotal role in guiding children on enriching their competitive side as well as the dangers of mediocrity, overachievement, and attaching their self-esteem to contests.

What about children who are trained to cooperate than compete? As others would believe, have greater potential to contribute as adults in the future. This is because every industry requires the principal skill of collaborating with people of different specializations to achieve their overall vision. A healthy competition is welcome as long as there is mutual respect and understanding; otherwise, it may be detrimental to the individual, the companies, and organizations. Competition based on the intent of beating the opponent tend to harbor negative emotions and may cost more than the reward; but competition on the grounds of refining one’s abilities to become the best in a particular craft have higher chances of receiving opportunities in the future.

I reckon that collaboration is the most important skill that should be augmented during childhood, because this stage of life is where most of our personality traits and habits are formed. The most successful leaders are followed, respected, and revered because of their ability to work with and not against people. It they are able to work together at an early age to attain a common goal, the chances of creating a positive ripple effect are higher for future generations. ",Yes,No,Yes,No,6
Many people prefer to watch foreign films than locally produced films. Why could this be? Should governments give more financial support to local film industries?,"In our developing world majority of smart people love watching overseas films rather than domestic films. There are dozen of reasons of this trend and governments can solve this problem by allocating subsidies.

Nowadays, it is the film industry that the main source of income of developing countruies is. (USA, France, India) People from other countries which film industry does not developed well prefer to watch foreign films. In those developed countries filmmakers have huge budget that helps them to buy high quality equipments, digital cameras and better audio systems. For the audience plot of movie, digital effects, actors are the main factors to choose films. Lack of these factors in local film making companies make people to refuse watching local movies. Some people think that local actors can not play their role effectively. On the other hand some talented actors left their own country, move abroad to find highly paid jobs there. Lack of budget and actors hinders film makers to generate high quality films.

In my opinion, it is government that should revive film industry of its own country. As I mentioned beforehand, some countries in the world get more profit from film industry. If government support film industry, country will benefit not only from film industry but also from tourism. For example, after demonstratiton of Turkey made film “The gift”, a number of tourists coming to Turkey increased. In addition, both governments and film producing companies can get profit from theater tickets. Therefore, firstly, governments must give subsidies to the local film makers. Secondly, governments can give scholarships to the talented actors and film makers, to send them developing countries. Thirdly, governments can restrict the piracy to encourage local film producers.

Overall, many people in the world find foreign movies more interesting and attractive. This idea are supported by many acceptable reasons. Governments can encourage its own people to watch local movies by developing local film industry. By giving subsidies and scholarships governments can assist local film makers to improve and generate high quality films. ",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7

People who cause their own illnesses through unhealthy lifestyles and poor diets should have to pay more for health care. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"Healthcare costs all over the world are rising due to the rise in modern diseases which are a product of unhealthy lifestyles. These Lifestyles include poor diet, smoking and lack of exercise. While many people do not need to use medical services, there are others who constantly need medication due to their unhealthy daily lives. In my view people who are responsible for their own illness should have to contribute towards the cost of their medical treatment.

First of all, it is important to highlight the fact that ignorance is not an excuse. Information about health and fitness is widely available so everyone should know that smoking and eating fast food are not only bad for our health, but can cause serious diseases. Furthermore, there is a wide range of help services which people can consult for advice on improving their health from doctors to sports trainers and dieticians. People who continue to live unhealthy lifestyles despite advice from doctors or medical professional should not receive free or reduced cost medical services.

Secondly, it is clear that certain types of treatment are very expensive and some diseases can be prevented by adopting a healthy lifestyle. If people who are obese require treatment, they are taking money away from another patient, whose operation or treatment may be costly, but necessary. Therefore, it could be a good solution to make people pay some money towards the cost of their treatment. If their health improved, this payment could be reduced.

In conclusion, making people contribute towards the cost of medical treatment for self-inflicted diseases could help reduce this type of disease and make more money available for other people. ",Yes,No,Yes,No,6
"In some countries, owning a home rather that renting one is very imporatnt for people. why might this be the case? do you think this is a positive or negative situation?","The issue of the importance of purchasing a house instead of renting one in several countries has grown in importance over the past decades. The significant reasons why they would like to have a house are a sense of owning and not paying the amount of money monthly. In my opinion, the advantages to this situation outweigh its drawbacks.

The variety of causes that the large number of residents living in some countries are willing to have their own house. First and foremost, they would gain a sense of owning if they purchase a pace to reside. In other words, they do not need to move another house after the ending their contracts. Another strongest reason is that a considerable number of social members find it difficult to pay the certain amount their income for renting an accommodation on a monthly basis.

Although purchasing a home as opposed to renting it has disadvantages, this have more merits for various reasons. To my mind, the convincing reason is that owners provide their families with the feeling of comfortable. The compelling evidence that altering the decoration of a house, renovating it in order to expand space and changing wall colors for instance, without getting permission of their owner is capable of making them extensive pleasant to all members of a household.

In conclusion and give my opinion, in the number of countries, buying a home overrides renting one owing to finding a sense of owning and not paying a part of their wages to renting regularly. The pros is more prominent than corns because of giving a sense of comfort to their families with refurbishing their house without permitting owners.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7
"Recently, abortion increases rapidly and becomes a controversial topic. Some people suppose that abortion should be legal while others are against it. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","In modern days, the early termination of pregnancy is a growing problem and it’s debatable. While a number of believe that abortion should be judicial while other not. In my opinion, this is a cruel act which result in developing diseases and behavior problems to humanity. This essay will discuss the pro and cons and why I feel it’s not a rightful to-do with supporting arguments.

Numerous people support abortion due to the fact the couple think they do not want to have an additional responsibility of a child when they are not financially stable and prepared to start a new life. At this stage, they are reluctant to have a new addition in their family due to financial overheads. As a result, they choose to terminate their pregnancy. A recent survey from World Child Care Organization conducted in India reveals that 75% of pregnancy terminations are due to financial instabilities. Hence, they demand this trend should be legal.

Conversely, the continuous practicing of aborting is awful act and such actions have serious consequences in women health. Furthermore, the failure to take responsibility will result in behavior problems. For instance, Ministry of Health Department in the USA has warned their fellow citizens to be aware on the health implications such uterus cancer and mental disorder are frequently diagnosed in women who had undergone unnatural birth control activities. Another survey from Times now news channel reported from the USA that more 80% of abortion cases were youngster and remaining 20% were adults. Therefore, considering women health and risk to younger ones in our society, there is no reason for having this act as constitutional.

In conclusion, every human in this world has their own rights. However, there is nothing essential other than women life. Therefore, I stand against or oppose the view of passing abortion as a legal and this act should be prohibitedby national authority",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7

Meanwhile, due to this reason, numerous people consider that, this would lead english being solo language in the world. Having a single language in the world can facilitate communication between people, while majority of nations can experience extinction.

Turning to the positive effects of it, firstly, it can ease relationships between countries in different fields.

Secondly, education will witness a huge growth, because everybody could have opportunity to study abroad without any restriction. Nowadays, a number of scholarships all over the world demand high level of English. Many students from poor countries can’t afford it due to lack of money or English courses.

Some organisations believe that their employees should dress smartly. Others value the quality of work above appearance. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.,"It is highly debatable about the dresses the employees wear in any office. Some employers give importance on the way their employees dress up on the contrary, there are many organisations who believe on the quality of work. However, I will be discussing on the given statement and put forth my opinion below.

Firstly, smart dressing can provide positive approach. It is believed that when others reach organisation it makes them feel good to get involved with the staffs. For instance, when one approaches a bank, usually people feel good to see employees who have smartly dressed and most time customers would like to interact with them and solve their issues. Secondly, being clean and tidy. If the organisation has more of outside people involved, it is always better for them to ask their employees to dress up smart to show up culture of the organisation. Moreover, this can influence a majority of their clients and improve their business.

On the other hand, there are employers who give more importance to performance. One of the major reasons is the organisation may not be directly involved with clients. For example, it is often found in designing companies that the staffs do give keen interest on clothing on the contrary, they are more smart in the work they do. In addition, such organisations believe that even the time they take to dress up can help them to improve their business. Although there are people who believe that wrong instances can come acrosse the work if their staffs give priority to clothing. However, majority companies in india have dress codes and are asked to wear the same

On pouring upon both the views, in my opinion organisations must give importance to attire since this can highly motivate and give a pleasant feeling to work on. For instance, some people enjoy dressing up regularly and others get a positive vibe. This can motivate everyone. ",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7
"A person's worth nowadays seems to be judged according to social status and material possessions,old fashioned values such as kindness,honour and trust no longer seem important.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?","Today, wealthy and influential people get more accolades of members of the society than people with noble character. While l agree that self importance is attributed to social class and how rich a person is, l do not agree individuals with good integrity are considered less significant in the society.

On the one hand, being affluent command respect and acceptance by community members as majority of people believe only the rich can take up leadership role in key political positions. Furthermore, judging individuals worth based on the magnitude of their material possession affect contributions to the growth and development of the community in which they reside. A good example of this is the wealthy people voted for based on their social contributions to their community in 2019 election in Nigeria to occupied various political post.

However, I disagree with the idea that people of reputable quality are less essential this day as they used to be in time past. Just as material possession is important so also is a man's integrity in today's society. People of good moral standard serves as role model for generation to come. Equally, individuals with good character impact others positively more especially the youths. For instance, parents of high moral standard influences their children in a positive way to be good children just like them.

In conclusion, although members of the society value and respect people due to their material possession, I believe that people of good uprightness are still considered more crucial and hold in high-esteem in the society.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7
Some people think it is better to choose friends who always have the same opinions as them. Other people believe it is good to have friends who sometimes disagree with them.,"Some would argue that choosing friends with same ideas is so useful, while others say that having friends with different opinions has more advantages. While choosing someone as a friend with different think might be a good idea, but I believe that it is better to select a friend with the same thought.

On the one hand, choosing a friend with different think has huge negative impacts on people life. Two people with different ideas and opinions have to discuss in many aspects and tend to persuade each other, and they also have difficulties to make a final decision regarding the debate topic. These kinds of relationship cause to decline the respect and get them to irritate for any issues even not the important one. For example, during my childhood, I had a friend with a completely different idea and we never could arrange and make a decision on the same topic. I believe that this kind of friendship no has any positive effect on people life.

On the other hand, when people get familiar with someone who has the same beliefs and idea with them, they could experience so many astonishing issues in their life. People with common think and opinion can understand each other completely and respect the other's idea and decision and do some favour for each other. They also get on well and have lots of fun without any debate and discussion and have long term friendship. For Instance, in my own country, the majority of people that have friends with same opinion encounter and experience amazing times with them. I presume that this type of friendship is so preferable and included so beneficial for people’s life.

In conclusion, having friends with different ideas has a negative impact and I assume that it is better for people to choose a friend with the same opinion to enjoy their time",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7
The idea of having a single career is becoming an old fashioned one. The new fashion will be to have several careers or ways of earning money and further education will be something that continues throughout life.,"Nowadays it is very common that people pursue more than occupation. People are now attracted in different professions to make healthy savings. Basically, there are two main reasons lie in this fact. One cause is, the ever-changing technology and the other one is financial conditions. Consequently, people are eager to learn and develop new skill sets to adopt to the new living conditions.

Science and Technology opens a new avenue in modern life. It has a greater ripple effect on every humankind. This improvement has changed the thought process and attitude of every working individuals. The impact of technological change are enormous. It pairs very well between the labor and capital to generate revenue. For example, the automobile industry uses the computer programs to improve the fuel efficiency. Many other inventions have similar effects. Not only it creates new job scope, it also allows people to learn different field work and excel simultaneously. From a recent survey, it is revealed that, more than 100 skill centers are created in every town due to raising job positon and demand from people to take multiple courses.

On the other hand, soaring competition also encourage people to explore more than one area. Job security is no longer guaranteed in any organization. People may lose job anytime and to protect themselves from such catastrophic effect, they are working two or three jobs. For example, a sales man not only works as marketing executive but also a real-estate agent. A computer engineer may run a blog on free time to make extra savings for his family. Hence, the fact is very clear that, there is no one want to risk or take chances on their financial security and stability. The evolution of internet and telecommuting is inevitable which motivate people to be more enthusiastic and work from anywhere without quitting their full-time job.

To conclusion, growth of technology and financial instability are the factors to drive people to pursue multiple careers. The availability of new roles in the market just made easily accessible for them. ",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7
"it is said that the fast pace of our everyday life, as a direct result of the rapid development of telecommunications technology and the travel industry, has negative effects on individuals, nations, globe.","In recent decades, according to a number of people, the swift rate of progress of some high-tech in communication and commutation which have been imprinting on our daily life has negatively made an impression on people, nations, and world. I tend to disagree with this argument, nevertheless, I believe that by the benefits of this development, its drawbacks cannot be ignored and in this essay, I will discuss both sides of the topic.

On one hand, thanks to the developing technology, people around the world are able to connect with each other remotely in seconds. Indeed, this fast connection along with improving the transportation system has assisted to boost international trade, growth of the global economy, and in summary, led to the development of more and more nations in all fields. To illustrate this, in the past, businessmen for marketing the local goods internationally, irrespective of wasting huge time and energy, rarely received all markets. While today not only does all commerce access whole world markets but also transactions are done quickly and without any requirement for traveling.

On the other hand, it should be taken into consideration the negative side of this progress. Simply put, telecommunications has been gradually eliminating face-to-face relationships and converting individuals into an isolated person. According to psychological researchers, this is more likely to damage society due to the fact of the increasing criminal aspects of this manner of life. Also, in terms of the travel industry, it is obvious that through this boom accelerating the destruction of the environment and annoying traffic congestion are tangible.

Overall, although it seems these developments are hard on societies, advantages them are noticeable and have been serving mankind noticeably. ",Yes,No,Yes,No,6
"When people move to a new country, they often face a difficult choice between maintaining their own customs and adopting customs of the country they moved to. In your opinion, which is better??Give specifics details and reasons to support your viewpoint.","More and more people today move to a new country in order to have an easiest life but the face a problem there. They cannot decide if they will maintain the customs that they had in the previous country or if they will adopt new ones. In my opinion, they should choose the first view for many reasons that will be examined below.

First of all, every person who leaves from a country and moves to another one usually misses the land they used to live before. To be more specific, maintain the customs of the country that you used to live, help you as it reminds you this country. For example some customs are related with some holidays. There are hundredths holidays but not all of them are celebrated to all the countries. This means that somebody can celebrate a holiday that it is not used to celebrate in this country in order to remind him how nice he lived there.

First of all, many customs nowadays were lost because no one was care about their maintenance. What I mean is that if everyone who moves on a different country adopts new customs and forget about the old ones the latest will be disappeared. Additionally, by preserving the customs you honor your fatherland. Extensively, with this act of kindness you will be a good example for those who have moved before as you can show them that you should never forget about your fatherland.

To sum up, people who relocate they have a doubt if they have should preserve their own customs or they should adopt new ones. In my opinion I consider that those people should appreciate and love the country that they live now but they must not forget about their father land. ",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7
Some people think that school children need to learn practical skills such as car maintenance and bank account management along with the academic subject school. To what extend do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays the students are learning many things within a school lesson. They are learning mostly about some theoretical skills such as history, math and chemistry. But some people think that the students should be taught more about practical skills that will help them to survive when they grow up such us car maintenance and bank account management. In my opinion both views are equally important.

To begin with, more practical skills will help youngsters to face many problems. To be more specific, those skills are something very useful as they will help them to live more easily and face every daily difficulty that might show up during their life. For example, if the students learn how to manage their bank account they will make purchases and they will never face a financial problem. Also another significant practical skill is the car maintenance. For example they will be helped a lot as they will have the knowledge on how to react if they stuck in the middle of nowhere.

But, except from the practical skills the students should teach theoretical subjects to broaden their horizons. Subjects such as chemistry and biology are extremely important for a doctor as he cannot diagnose a disease without that. Additionally, philosophy and history are important for a teacher so that he can teach his knowledge to the next generations. What I mean is that the theoretical skills that the youngsters learn in school is significant because those subjects are that will help them understand the practical skills and then they can combine all the knowledge they have and live a nice life.

To sum up some people believe that the students have to learn except from the academics subjects some practical skills. Personally I think that practical skills should be taught in school as long as the teachers do not limit the theoretical subjects.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7
"You should spend about 40 minutes on this task. Write about the following topic. Are famous people treated unfairly by the media? Should they be given more privacy, or is the price of their fame an invasion into their private life? Discuss both these views and give your own opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. You should write at least 250 words.","Nowadays the media industry has transformed into a high flying Eagle which is watching every movement of all the individuals especially the rich and famous personalities of the country.

I am of a strong opinion that the famous personalities whether be it actors, politicians or big businessmen, are treated unfairly by the glaring eyes of media and are not left alone in any of their private moments. For e. g. Karan Johar, Salman Khan and many other actors are followed throughout the day and even the smallest of their activity is captured on camera. Recently the marital discord between Malaika Arora Khan and Arbaz Khan was in the news twenty four hours a day and news channels were making opinions on what would have gone wrong between the both of them.

On the other hand, many people are of the opinion that they are influencers, not only for the younger generation but across the width and breadth of the age groups. People want to follow what they do, how they do. This automatically opens up the pandora box of their private lives as the followers and fans are the ones, who take the celebrities become famous and rich and eventually this gives them the right to invade their private lives.

There is a saying - ""with more responsibility, comes, more power"". To conclude I would want to mention that media needs to follow this quote and understand that they have the responsibility of providing the right information and that power should not be misused to invade into the private lives of the famous and rich people.

"In most cultures, people are taught to respect the elderly. Is it important to respect the elderly? How does one demonstrate respect to the elderly?Be specific and give concrete response","It is a pretty well known fact, that in the majority of countries people show respect to the elderly ones. This gesture shows good behavior and discipline. In my opinion it is very important to demonstrate respect to the elderly people for many reasons, which many of them will be examined below.

To start with, in my country Greece the demonstration of respect to the old people is something that someone can be find in every family and in every person’s principals, with very little exceptions. We believe that this is very important for them because as time goes by they get older and they feel more lonely and disappointed, so what we have to do is to show them our love and appreciation. Moreover, it is a usual phenomenon that when the parents are in work they call their kids’ grandparents to keep an eye on them until they come back. I believe that this is a very serious reason to respect our grandparents and generally the elderly people

There are many ways to show our respect to an old person. In case he is a relative of us, we can show our respect and love by giving him a kiss or call him for a dinner. Furthermore, a good option is to buy him a gift that he was always wanted. Also if we see someone old enough who cannot pass the driveway, it will be great for him to help him pass easy and safe. Last but not least we should avoid talking to them baldly and not paying attention to them because they feel sad something that is very bad for an old person.

To end up I deeply believe that we must show respect and have time with the elderly people because they deserve it and that will make happy not only us but the old person too. 
",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7
"In most cultures, people are taught to respect the elderly. Is it important to respect the elderly? How does one demonstrate respect to the elderly?Be specific and give concrete response","In a big number of countries, the majority of people are taught to show respect to the older generations. This is something really significant and can be shown in a lot of ways some of which are going to be mentioned below.

To begin with, respecting the elderly it is of a high importance because are the ones who raised and educated us. This means that they already have sacrified a lot in order for us to become successful adults and one of the minimal things that we could do is appreciate them. Besides this we need to maintain this kind of behaviour around them because they always were beside us during difficult times so we can feel at ease again and get a hold of ourselves. No matter how you see it they have done a great deal of things for us so respecting them is a must.

Obviously, there are a lot of ways to show your respect one of which is to help them do things they are not able to do anymore like lifting heavy objects. We could also provide them with food and medicine when nessecery just like they did it for us when we were young to show them that we appreciate what they have done through all these years. And last but not least is to make sure when we don't see them to call them so they can feel loved and that there are people that care for them.

In conclusion, respecting elderly should be a characteristic of every young persons personality for a lot of reasons and there plenty ways to accomplish this. Fortunately, this kind of behaviour is being adopted by more and more individuals leading to a reassuring future. ",Yes,No,Yes,No,6
"Write about the following topic: In the past, most people lived in small villages where everyone knew everyone else. Nowadays, most people live in large cities where they only know a few people in their area. What do you think were the advantages and disadvantages of living in a small community? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge and experience. Write at least 250 words.","In the past, we lived in small communities, small villages and nowadays we are living in a big communities, large cities. But let's focus on the past, what was the advantages and disadvantages of a living in a small communities.

I think advantages of living in a small communities was people didn't feel awkward with each other because they were close. If any of family in the village had a emergency problem, they can called help from other quickly because there house were against to each other,

About the disadvantages of living in a small villages was they got bored of their neighboor and people surrounded them because they were too similar. They didn't get a choice to communicate with new people outside their area so their social communication skill was limited. They didn't have many new friends.

In my opinion, living in a small villages let you to live close to your family and friends. But, you can just live like that, I love to experience new things and communicate with different people. Living in a big city is appropriate for me. ",Yes,No,Yes,No,6
"The funds for postgraduate research are limited; therefore some people think that the government should provide financial support. In their opinion, only scientific research should be funded, rather than other less useful subjects. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In the contemporary era, there is heated argument over the issue that, many individuals say that instead of providing loans to postgraduate studies and for the scientific fields, authorities should provide loans for non scientific fields and scholars. A lion's share of society favours it, however the rest go adverse it. The following paragraphs would shed light on my personal perspective a long wide and example.

To commence with the view of private loans for postgraduate studies. first and foremost, there are myraid benefits for funding the scientific field. As a result, it helps to expand scientific knowledge for new innovations with the assistance of this new technology. Secondly, issuing funds for postgraduate studies it mainly helps to poor masses children's to study more and make their country better by making new changes in their society. As an examplify, with the aid of new technologies invention such as motor vehicles, home appliances and many more items makes our lives better and comfortable.

On the flip side of coin, some critics go against the above discussed assertions. Issuing the money funds for schoolars is beneficial for new generation because it is a truth that nowadays many children does not know about their historical background and they also forgot about their rituals and ancestors life for the reason that advancement in technology. Moreover, giving loans to non scientific field as like business law and art helps to students to know more about society and business new techniques.

Hammering the last naiI, I am of the opinion that, there is a need for such loans not only for scientific fields but also for non scientific field. Although, both areas provides greater value to individuals. 
",Yes,No,Yes,No,6
"The government cannot fund all research projects because its budget is limited; therefore, some people insist that only research pertaining to the field of science and technology should receive government funding.","The government cannot fund all research projects because its budget is limited; therefore, some people insist that only research pertaining to the field of science and technology should receive government funding. While I do admit that scientific research should receive maximum funding, I totally disagree with the argument that the government should stop funding research in less ‘useful’ fields like arts or history.

Scientific research certainly provides tremendous value because scientific innovations have the power to change our lives for good. Take, for instance, the invention of the antibiotic. This wonder drug saved the lives of millions of people and continues to be a major lifesaver even today. The computer is also the result of scientific research. This invention changed the way we work and store information. Today, it is impossible to imagine a world without computers. Other inventions like electricity, motor vehicles and home appliances have also revolutionized our lives.

However, just because scientific research provides more value it does not mean that research in other ‘less useful’ fields should be discouraged. Of course, archeological research or research into the origin of languages is unlikely to have a massive impact on our day-to-day life. Yet, this information is crucial for understanding how we reached where we are today. The truth is that there are still a lot of things we can learn from previous generations. These kinds of research may even lead us to a common ancestor and that might put an end to the hostility prevailing between many nations. Historical research also teaches us about mistakes we must not repeat. The World Wars and the Genocide are two examples. Research on these horrific incidents keeps reminding us about the extent of damage they caused. If future generations do not learn about them, they might be tempted to commit the same mistakes again.

To conclude, not only scientific research but research in other fields also provides great value. Therefore, the argument that only scientific research should receive government funding does not hold water. ",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7
"In many countries, paying for things using mobile phone (cellphone) app is becoming increasingly common. Does this development have more advantages or more disadvantages?","technology revolution is leading us to the era that never appeared in the imagination of our ancestors. , especially modern tap and pay method allows us to buy goods with just a tap of phone onto the POS machine, it is debatable that cashless payment is exposing ourselves on risk of compromising personal privacy and people rather adhere to conventional paper based payment, however using mobile phone to finalize payment seems has more advantages over traditional paper based payment, especially in the sense of lifting the restriction of payment location as well as time saving.

Cashless payment has more advantages over cash payment in terms of cashless payment, in other words, paid by phone or apps allows us to execute the paying behaviour online without visiting the vendor in person, for example, paying our utilities bill online is easier, simpler than visiting the governmental facilities physically, in re-shaping of paying method brings great convenience to us and undoubtedly mobile phone will gradually replace cash payment.

furthermore, cash payment will be overwhelmed by cashless payment due to it saves ample time, paying online enable us to make the payment with few taps on screen rather than queuing in front of counters, for instance, online payment made the grocery shopping less time consuming as it would simply completed with few click on laptop, whereas cash purchase requires ones to visit and spending time at brick and mortar store, thus online payment has absolute advantage compare to conventional payment method.

To conclude, paying with mobile phone offers us more flexibility on location and save more times, traditional payment has less to offer in this aspect, thus paying with apps has greater advantage than cash, as the trend goes, hypothetically cash will be replaced with apps payment in majority fields.

"Some young people look forward to a year of traveling, a gap year before they begin work or university, and see it as a chance to broaden their horizons. For others, this is an expensive waste of time. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","A large number of adults are partial to gap year because of the opportunities provided for them to expand their view before absorbing by labor market or education environments, while others believe that it is costly and time-consuming. In my opinion, I believe, if people travel with the concept of collecting experience they will be more successful in their future.

Losing a year can have a detrimental effect on a person's future life. In today's fast-paced world, people have to work harder than ever to keep up, so spending a year on a trip seems irrational. Besides, young people are not economically independent, and the cost of travel may put more pressure and expense on their parents, especially for some economically disadvantaged people. So a year off can be a costly year with time lost.

Undoubtedly, not only does a gap year overdue attending university or entering the business world but also imposes an additional cost on them but obviously, the experience acquired from this long journey will change prospects of those that opt it before deciding for their educational and career future. One of the paramount decisions for each person is when we want to select the area to continue our study or work and reaching the best decision will occur when we accurately know ourselves. This cognition is simply achievable via dissimilar situations that we are intentionally or unintentionally located in the various journeys. Therefore, a gap year is the best time to know ourselves and expand not only our vision but also our knowledge of our life.

In conclusion, treasure obtained from a gap year in traveling is so valuable that people spend one year of their lives on it and bear its costs.",Yes,No,Yes,No,6
Traditional learning and E-learning,"Traditional learning is a formal version of training that takes place in a classroom. It is performed in front of the learners. On the other hand, E-learning is a web-based learning. It can be taken at any time by using an internet-connected device. Finally, there is blended learning, in which both traditional learning and E-learning will be mixed.

Traditional learning is a type of learning that people are most familiar with. The location of teaching is in the classroom. There is a teacher, who is presenting the materials. There are several advantages of traditional learning. Firstly, highly-trained teachers can adapt their presentations to the personality and skill level of the audiences in the classroom. Secondly, instructor-led training (ILT) in the traditional learning classes can divide the students to several brainstorming or role-playing groups. Students get an opportunity to learn from each other specially for collaborative subjects. Finally, one of the most important advantages of traditional learning is that students in a classroom setting are more engaged with the subject and they are more focused.

There are challenges or disadvantages of the traditional learning such as, high cost of running, inconsistent teaching styles of the teachers. Another disadvantage of traditional learning is the requirement of physical availability i. e. you cannot participate, if you are away from the location of the classroom. During COVID19 pandemic, schools with traditional learning had been changed to E-learning system.

E-learning is referring to any online training at any time in any location. Since it’s an online teaching, it includes many activities such as videos and images. Upcoming technologies in the E-learning is promising more immersion for students or employees, such as virtual reality simulations, augmented reality, interactive videos, geofenced training areas, gamification, mobile learning, and personalized learning paths. There are several advantages of E-learning. Firstly, E-learning is saving money such as travel costs. Secondly, It allows the students/employees with more flexibility to access the materials where and when they have the time to perform the tasks and this will suit for students/employees who travel to a distant location. Finally, the teacher can create personalized custom E-learning materials which can be tailored to match the specific learner by pause training, test out, or reread information they previously know. This increase the memorization of the information. To reach the above advantages of E-learning, the materials must be accessible and organized. The E-learning presentation must be promoted, but not distracted by animations and visuals.

There are some disadvantages of the E-learning such as, E-learning that depend on overly animations or flashy graphics will distract the students. E-learning can become quickly outdated for rapidly developing fields, unless active updating are part of the E-learning design process. There is less social interaction in E-learning. New skilled persons needed in E-learning. Similar to the traditional learning, E-learning courses must concentrate on the core principles of pedagogical design to concisely transfer the information to your students.

In conclusion, it depends on what your specific needs are. Some topics will greatly benefit from instructor-led training. However, some will be better matched to E-learning, but in some situations such as during coronavirus spreading you have only one choice (E-learning). It also depends on number of students per teacher and training resources. In general, mixed learning that includes both traditional and E-learning may work best for many as traditional learning can incorporate several different styles of learning and it also build relationships. But in the same time, E-learning is more flexible, and students can refer back to the materials over and over. Therefore, blended learning combine advantages of both options. It incorporates face-to-face and online elements and had a larger benefit than traditional or E-learning alone. ",Yes,No,Yes,No,6
Why teachers resist learner-centered pedagogy?,"First reason:

The teachers feel threatened when shifting the responsibility for learning to the students. It is difficult, especially for experienced teachers, to let go of complete control in the classroom and share power with students. The nature of learner-centered teaching shifts the balance of power in the classroom. In order for students to learn, they must be given more opportunity and responsibility to engage with the concepts and construct their own understanding.

What does the power shift look like?

It does not involve handing all of the power to the students and losing control as a leader. There is a reason you are the teacher. The power shift is more about sharing responsibility for learning with the students.

Second reason:

Some teachers believe that only very advanced and mature students would benefit from learner-centered approach. This is wrong because the beginner students can also learn enough from learner-centered approach. This approach can benefit any student despite their educational starting point.

Third reason:

The teachers believe that they are not able to cover enough content, if they switch their course from a teacher-centered approach to a more learner-centered one. Remember, the role of content in your class is to guide the knowledge base students must acquire, and to provide an opportunity for developing learning skills within that knowledge area. A learner-centered teaching approach uses content to achieve this, while a teacher-centered approach just covers all the content that can fit into the course. It is more important that the students learn how to use their acquired knowledge rather than know all the facts presented in the vacuum of a classroom. ",Yes,No,Yes,No,6
Proposal for Opening School of Nursing Soran University,"This document outlines the proposal for the establishment of a new school of nursing at the Soran University. The vision is to position the Soran University as an international leader in health professions, education, practice, and research. It aims at addressing the workforce needed for our community. The Soran Nursing School would be based in the Soran University, Ashty General Hospital, and Soran Children and Maternity Hospital in the Soran region.

The proposal is structured as follow: proposal overview; executive summary; justification; goals and objectives (vision and mission); core values; project activities (project requirements, work plan, key personnel, curriculum, and partners); monitoring and evaluation; sustainability; budget summary and budget narrative; and conclusion.

The health care industry is undergoing transformative changes due to many factors, including unsustainable increases in cost, an aging patient and nurse population, a primary care provider shortage, and the need to shift from a medical education and health care delivery system focused on providing episodic care to one designed to prevent and manage disease. To respond to this transformation, in November 2020, a team in the Soran University started to write a proposal on the feasibility of opening new nursing school in the Soran University with a partnership with two local hospitals. This educational plan includes a more robust evaluation of the needs for the financial and resource implications of a new nursing school. ",Yes,No,Yes,No,6
The need for nursing jobs will grow continuously.,"The need for nursing jobs will grow continuously. This is happening because we have a growing population that is aging and living longer than ever. As new, breakthrough medical therapies become available, people are living longer than they did just 20 years ago. These people also want to live more active and productive lives than in the past, so all of these are causing a surge in demand for healthcare workers. This is what is driving the demand for nurses, and there is a serious shortage of them throughout the world. This is good news for students who want to become a nurse. When the students earn their four year bachelor of science in nursing (BSN), they should be able to find a good-paying job in many hospitals and health centers around the country.

A four year BSN is the ideal choice for the student who does not have another bachelor’s degree and has little work experience in health care. If the students are an experienced professional with a bachelor’s degree in another field and are interested in nursing, they should consider an accelerated BSN (This is common way to become nurse who is holding BSN in USA)

The population of Soran region and the surrounding areas is more than 500000. There is no any nursing school in the Soran region. Therefore, the area is mainly dependent on the graduates from the college of nursing, Hawler medical university in Erbil to send nurses to cover the deficiency in nurses. Designing a new nursing school in Soran will solve the health workforce shortages in the Soran and the surrounding region and thus to assist in reducing the differences in health outcomes experienced in these communities. The new nursing school is highly justified as it will be the source for professional education. This will lead to increase in the number of nursing school graduates (nurses), who can practice in Soran and the surrounding rural areas.

Nursing school in the Soran University is planned to revolutionize the delivery of health care by transforming the quality and efficiency of regional and national health care delivery, making the nursing school graduate as a care leader, and serving as one of the leading nursing school in the Middle East. The nursing school will not be only for undergraduate study, but also a place for research, and scholarship. The school of nursing will produce a new breed of nurse-discoverer, nurse-inventor, nurse-scientist who is trained to solve the problems of the health care system, in addition to providing high-quality care to patients.

The new nursing school in the Soran University will have the capacity to address all of the challenges outlined above. It contains halls for classes, leisure activities for students during the rest. On the other hand, Ashty General Hospital and Soran Children and Maternity Hospital will be the main teaching hospitals which are linked to the school of nurse. Clinical Skills Centre will be another important place for the teaching. The future plan will be the development of education and research enterprise.

The shortage of nurses and other medical staff are very obvious in developed and developing countries. Opening new nursing schools became essential not only in Kurdistan, but also in the most developed countries. The need for nursing jobs will grow continuously. This is happening because we have a growing population that is aging and living longer than ever. As new, breakthrough medical therapies become available, people are living longer than they did just 20 years ago. These people also want to live more active and productive lives than in the past, so all of these are causing a surge in demand for healthcare workers.

The school of nursing will produce a new breed of nurse-discoverer, nurse-inventor, nurse-scientist who is trained to solve the problems of the health care system, in addition to providing high-quality care to patients.

The new nursing school in the Soran University will have the capacity to address all of the challenges outlined above. It contains halls for classes, leisure activities for students during the rest. On the other hand, Ashty General Hospital and Soran Children and Maternity Hospital will be the main teaching hospitals which are linked to the school of nurse. Clinical Skills Centre will be another important place for the teaching. The future plan will be the development of education and research enterprise.

The shortage of nurses and other medical staff are very obvious in developed and developing countries. Opening new nursing schools became essential not only in Kurdistan, but also in the most developed countries. ",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7
Every person is essential to the development of a country. Talk about what you think is your role in the development of your country. Use specific reasons and examples in your explanation,"Government play most important role stops against human trafficking, government how to stop, which step they should take, how to protect their citizen. If we talk about identification, the documents on how to help stop human trafficking, we need to adopt measures to reduces vulnerability by ensuring that they have legal documents like birth certificate, citizenship prof they are this county person, and marriage certificate which government issue for all persons in their country. These documents are very useful for every citizen because we can find victims and we can analyze the system of human trafficking. If they don’t have these types of documents we cannot find where are the victims and, where he /she came from, how they become victim, because if they have these kinds of documents thus, we can find easily information and take action about it.

Each and every government should launch the identification of their home country, we can recognize this person of this country citizen. One more thing, the government has to take every six months or one-year data collection of their village, cities, country. If they take data so they easily find who is missing? This data collection operates centrally so local, regional, national, and country-level find, who is become a victim so governments put their data centrally. After six months and years, the country has to analyze how many people are missing. If they analyze so they get information about it. And the government arranges regular inspections and creates unite teams so they can go and check there see what happens there. For example, industry, domestic work, agriculture, or construction.

The government must create strict rules and regulations so everyone has to follow their rule and regulation. If someone breaks the rules government should give them a penalty. Municipalities also play a very important role in human trafficking, and they actively looking for and identifying the signs because their staff receives training from the police on how to handle and how to deal with the human trafficking problem and there are works on actives detections of human trafficking, which they can an operate.

Some other municipalities decided themselves how they wish to fulfill their role in tackling human trafficking. Such as, so they can make rules and regulations and also make policy that helps combat human trafficking. They can also provide better shelter and care for victims of human trafficking within the municipality. They need to raise awareness that human trafficking is a crime and transfer people to shop for it.",Yes,No,Yes,Yes,7
Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is an important option for renal replacement therapy,"Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is one of the options for renal replacement therapy in patients with end-stage kidney failure. PD offers home dialysis permitting patients to be autonomous from the hospital. However prolonged usage of PD may be limited by scarring and fibrosis of the peritoneal membrane (Fusshoeller 2008). In some 3% of patients on PD, a rare but potentially fatal complication can develop known as encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS).

EPS is a difficult disease to study for several reasons such as it is rare disease with vague diagnostic criteria and there is no clear diagnostic test (Kawanishi, Harada et al. 2001, Korte, Sampimon et al. 2011). There is difficulty in finding suitable animal models in EPS study. The important differences in the animal models in comparison to PD in humans remain the main problem (Nikitidou, Peppa et al. 2015) for example, long incubation time is an important factor in EPS, while long incubation period is difficult in animal models. There is even disagreement as to whether EPS represents the severe end of a continuum of peritoneal sclerosis (PS) or they are entirely two different pathological entities. Aetiopathogeny of EPS has not been explained clearly and changes in peritoneal function could be due to the reflection of effects of long exposure to PD (De Sousa, del Peso-Gilsanz et al. 2012). However, those PD patients who are developing EPS have a tendency to UF failure before stopping PD (Lambie, John et al. 2010). ",Yes,No,Yes,No,6

Some people prefer to live in a house while others feel that there are more advantages to living in an apartment. Are there more advantages than disadvantages of living in a house compared with an apartment.,"The right to safe and secure shelter is one the most fundamental human rights. It is a difficult task to choose between these two. Though some people think it is nice to live in a house rather than stay in an apartment. This essay will compare residence in a house and an apartment according to their positive and negative aspects.

First of all, a house is a traditional residence for people who want to live in peace and privacy. One can acquire plenty of privileges such as fresh air and abundance of space. For instance, if one thinks about the conventional houses, one may imagine a wooden or brick house standing amongst trees with a beautiful flowery garden, which will also provide a feeling of freedom. However, this kind comfort does not come cheap, for the luxury of space and quality handsome amounts which are increasingly becoming out of reach for people. Ultimately, a house offers priceless comfort and a space you can call home which you cannot find in the most luxurious hotels in the world. So, it is clear that despite the expense, a house is much better to stay with a handful of problems like lack of security and modern services.

On the other hand, if we shed light on the pros and cons of the apartment, it seems a tiny place just enough to get by. There is limited opportunity for private open space and fresh air, as there is no room left for planting trees or flowers. In short, an apartment only reminds us about multiple storied boring buildings standing side by side filled with a lot of humans. Even though it does not provide one comfy ventilation and ample room, it gives one security and a tension free accomodation with all modern supplies.

This essay discussed both the benefits and limitations of the house and apartment. In conclusion the accommodation preference is dependent on personal taste and affordability, which varies. . . . ",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7

I do believe in the fact that the greatest lessons we acquire from our life is not from the schools we attend but from the mistakes we make, which i call it the best teacher that makes a change in our lives.

The more mistakes we make the more experience we gain, It is so important to live our lives fully as human beings by this i mean experiencing every aspect of life.

This summer i read a book called Think And Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill, which was one of life changing experience for me, as i was going through pages i noticed that the greatest inventors, entrepreneurs, scientists never achieved their goals without failing thousand times. For sure what leads us to success after failure is our wisdom and our belief in ourselves.

Nobody's life is perfect and we are all fallible, but we as human beings, we do have the ability to change our circumstances by using our mind power.

As a twenty one year old guy, i have made a mistake which completely opened my eyes to see the right and the best thing for me.

Since when i started knowing myself i have always dreamed of serving people and for that reason there was two fields of study in my mind to pursue at a university in the future, one was Politics and the other one was Medicine but as years passed i kept listening to others instead of following my heart's voice.

After graduating from high school my parents advised me to study Medicine because they believed that it was the optimum choice for me and also it was lucrative job. without hesitation i agreed to their request since i was their only child so that played crucial role to obey to them and applied to a university which was completely different and bizarre to my goals and dreams.

From the moment i started reading medical books i knew i wasn't accomplishing anything because i was never going to be creative in that field by that i was not going to be able to touch people's life the way i wanted.

It took me two years to confess to my parents that it was not my real passion, so i wanted to leave the university before being too late. Yes, i failed at completing medicine but it made me realize that what i really wanted was studying politics, the only way to serve people and touch their hearts without using my hands by my good work and kindness.

Failure is a blessing in disguise, which i agree to, because it showed me my real desire.

In conclusion my failing experience taught me that the greatest mistake we do when we listen to others while we have ourselves to draw our own path in our lives that lead us to success. ",Yes,No,Yes,No,6
"It is commonly believed that nowadays main factors that affect a child's development are media, pop culture and friends. A different point of view is that family plays the most significant role. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","A person's personality is formed under the influence of family upbringing and external factors. Some people argue that external factors such as peer, media and teacher pressures have more effect on children temper than family. This essay will discuss both these points of view and argue in favour of the latter.

One the one hand, The books children read and the music they listen, form their beliefs and faiths. In other words, children tend to follow and imitate the behaviour of their favourite personality. Moreover, when a children are in school or play in playground, they are influenced by their peers. Finally, other factors, like the media, prompt children to want things regarded as fashionable. For instance, children demand toys that they see on television. Therefore, some people argue that external factors have an undeniable influence on the life of children and are predominant in shaping their future.

On the other hand, a child's personality is malleable at a very young age, and parents are often present in their life at this stage. Also, very young children love to imitate their parent's behavior. For example, children who have a dysfunctional family often exhibit behavioural problems at school. That is while, An emotionally safe home environment is critical for the child's confidence. Moreover, parents also teach children about setting boundaries. It is their behavior and upbringing that teaches children what friends to choose, what books to read, and what movies to watch.

Therefore, In my opinion, children's choice of friends, books or music and etc. depends on the values inspired in them by their parents. Therefore, parents hold more substantial mastery over their offspring than media, pop culture and friend groups.

In conclusion, it is undeniable that the outside world affects the intellectual and social development of children. However, I believe that it is the parents who, from a very young age, provide the ground for the positive or negative direction of these developments. ",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7

Experiencing two different wars in my life showed me that by the acts of the politicians our fate is decided and i prefer studying Politics because of my willingness to diligently serve people, make the unheard voices heard, also building and shaping our next generations lives with morally acceptable rules by eliminating the deformities in our current corrupt system which affects on our life.

Because of it's good reputation and advanced educating system, intrigued me to study at AUA.

It's accredited degree and it's cooperation with international universities and organizations excites me even more to pursue a degree and discover it more.

I am sure that AUA will leave a great impact on my academical life, it would be an honor to be one of the first students of this newly launched major.

Acquiring politics major in a recognized university from the greatest professors who are highly skilled and developed in their fields will be an opportunity for me in building my future.

One of the qualities that AUA has is its teaching method with experience, by studying politics i cannot wait to join the conferences done by AUA.

In my future goals, i would like to serve my people in international organizations to represent and help my country to shape and rebuild for the better and also creating a good team to help world's most vulnerable. ",Yes,No,Yes,No,6
Some believe that charitable organisations should help people no matter where they live. Others argue thar charities should only help those living in the country where the charity is based. discuss both the views and give your opinion,"It is often considered that of late some people think that charitable organisation help the people all over the world whereas other think these charity help those who living in the country where the charity is found. It has been prevaling concern in the significant part of the world. A sea change has been witnessed in the past few years, the following paragraph would elucidate both the views. Firstly, these organisations have massive contribution in the society. It has always included teaching to next generation how to be a good member of society. I think charitable organisation helps the people no matter where they live for instance NHO organisation which would help the blind people NHO company make their organisation attrative and affordable to the society. Secondly, this focous is wide ranging and inspring for the society on the other hand some people think charity help those who live in their own country where charity was established, each method is unique with its own way of life and own perspetive for example poor people reap the benefits of these organisation because it cheap and affordable for the customers. To sum up, charitable organisation is must for the society, which would develop deeper understanding and strengthen their ability all charity all charity are contributing factor for the society.

Crime is a big problem in the world; many believe that nothing can be done to prevent it. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give your own opinion.,"In certain countries, it is preferred that students should take a year off from studies after completing high school, prior to joining universities and during this period they are encouraged to work or to travel. Even though this seems to be a noble concept, it has its own merits and demerits and some of these will be illustrated in this essay.

Firstly, a year off, after completing years of continuous school education is a welcome break for students and is well deserved too. This period also serves as well earned family time for those pupils who grew up within the closed boundaries of boarding schools. Secondly, this period provides ample opportunities to young people, to experience the realities of the modern world. Those students who prefer a break, can experiment with various forms of employment and thereby decide their career goals and directions depending upon their experiences. The holidaymakers, on the other hand can familiarise with the customs and cultures of various countries, which in turn will widen their outlook and will also promote cultural tolerance. Thus, in a wider perspective, such breaks help the young minds in preparing for the much demanding university life.

In contrast, certain disadvantages are definitely associated with this concept and are worth mentioning. Firstly, scholars are of the opinion that, such breaks from studies, during the learning phase of life, affects further education. According to them, such activities should not be encouraged as there are higher chances that the young minds might loose interest in learning or may get demotivated due to various reasons and might ultimately refrain from pursuing university education. Secondly, the employed youth, due to a sudden increase in their purchasing power, might also get attracted to various social evils like drugs, gambling and alcoholism.

Thus to sum up, it will be wise to comment that such policies even though are noble practices, should not be made mandatory in a national scale, as these activities are also associated with considerable negative outcome. ",Yes,No,Yes,No,6
"Given the power and influence of the super rich, it might seem as if social status and material possessions are the new symbols of personal worth, but in everyday life I do not think this is true.","Given the power and influence of the super rich, it might seem as if social status and material possessions are the new symbols of personal worth, but in everyday life I do not think this is true. It is apparent that most celebrities today are admired or envied solely for their material wealth or position in various social hierarchies. Many of these people are known to turn their backs on friends, cheat on their spouses or spend their evenings over-indulging in alcohol and/or drugs. Things like owning a mansion, driving an expensive car and getting into A-list parties are exalted above old-fashioned values. Ultimately, though, it is the many readers of gossip magazines and celebrity blogs who reinforce these ideas. Nevertheless, I do believe that in their day-to-day lives most people still believe in values such as honour, kindness and trust. In some way most of us want to form loving families, raise our children to be good citizens, stand up for the downtrodden and protect our communities from harm. We still form friendships, romances and business partnerships based on old-fashioned criteria. When our trust is abused or we are unfairly treated, we see that as a major violation of our relationship and we judge the wrongdoer accordingly. In conclusion, I believe there is some truth to the notion that status and possessions have superseded old-fashioned values as a measure of a person’s worth. Looking beyond the tabloids, however, it is apparent that most ordinary people have still preserved an old-fashioned conscience. ",Yes,No,Yes,No,6
"Traffic and housing problems could be solved by moving large companies, factories and their employees to the countryside. Do you agree or disagree?","Traffic in the cities had become a big issue because of the massive population similarly, because of the vast masses the accommodation becomes a dilemma so some people suggest that relocating large factories to the countryside with their employees will solve this problem. I agree with removing large factories in the urban area but people should be supported by transportation facility.

Big industries in the cites might create noise and pollution which depend on the type of production of the company rather than that it occupy the massive area and create traffic around the location due to their numerous worker might commute by their individual vehicles to travel to the company which unintentionally form a traffic jam, for instance, Pricol a multinational companey was creating huge traffic problems likewise occupied a large amount of land inside the city so few individuals filed a case against that company after few years with public prosecutor they common people win the case and judge demanded to shift the company with in 1 year after a year the traffic was reduced up to 80% around the location.

To continue, People are paying 50% of their salary to accommodation. The place becomes expensive because of a shortage of lands. If gigantic companies move outside of the urban, there will be a drastic change in the rent price that people can afford it. the company space must be use to construct an affordable apartment. in Mumbai, a huge fight is going on at the present for place call Dharve, which is a slum in the city many business tycoons tried to capture this place but the people inside the area are resilient and opposing every offers because future generation should live in an affordable place.

to sum up, traffic and accomodation can be solved by shifting massive factories and companies out side of the cites. employees commuting problem can be solved by providing a company transportation service such as a bus.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7
Some people think it is a good thing for senior managers to have much higher salaries than the other workers in a company. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"There is a statement that the position of senior managers is much more profitable in comparison to other workers and there is nothing wrong with it. In this essay the topic of an existed gap between salaries of different workers will be discussed.

Getting a higher position is a task that requires considerable efforts, because employers pay attention to education and professional qualification of an employees. That is why advantange in salary seems to be completly logical in this case. For example, people who have graduated from a prestige university have spend a lot of time over the course of their studing. Therefore, they obtain some competence that will allow them to perform better in professional activities and as a consequence, they deserve more material gain because the company derive more profit from their work.

However, there is another issue that also should be taken into consideration. Team working is not limited by formal accomplishing your task and relationships between team members are also bear a great importance. If a difference between salaries is too enormous, most workers will be claim that company underestimate their contribution in the work process and their work should be paid better. Their discontent may have a detrimental affect to the productivity of a whole work team.

In conclusion, I would like to express my opinion regarding this topic. I state that there is should be a difference between slary of the senior managers and other workers, but it should not be absurdly tremendous in order to keep motivated all workers of the company. ",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7
In the past people wore their traditional clothes and followed their culture. These days most people wear similar clothes and therefore look very similar to one another. Do you think this is a positive or a negative development?,"These days, people’s perspectives on the value of clothing are changing, and individuals tend to wear similar clothing compared to people in the past who opted for their traditional clothing. I believe this tendency exerts a positive influence on the society.

It is certainly true that there are some drawbacks to this tendency because it may lead to a loss of global diversity. It can be argued those who wear ordinary clothes such as T-shirts and jeans cannot feel a connection to their roots, and they are likely to neglect their culture and the contribution of their ancestors. Therefore, these people may not take pride in their region, and they might migrate to an urban location rather than contribute to the development of their community. Consequently, many ethnic minorities could suffer from the depopulation and eventually disappear.

However, I believe that there are more positives than negatives in people opting for similar clothes. The first explanation is that individuals can feel a sense of unity with people all over the world even though they have different religions and ways of life. This mind would motivate people in the world to support one another, instead of thinking that different parts of the world should deal with their own problems when natural disasters and other terrible problems occur in different nations. Furthermore, this tendency is economically profitable. Generally speaking, as ordinary clothes are automatically manufactured, they can be produced faster and more affordably than traditional clothing such as Japanese Kimono, which is hand-crafted.

In conclusion, although people today tend to wear similar clothes instead of traditional ones and this trend will cause several problems, I believe that the society as a whole can reap more benefits of this tendency. ",Yes,No,Yes,No,6
It is more important to have a good family than to have friends. Family can always compensate for absence of friendship. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Numerous people would rather have one loyal comrade than have lots of acquaintances around the world. I agree also with this preference and think that a true friend is more worth.

First of all, I believe that the intimate mates give their friends a lot of motivation to overcome fierce time. In fact, not only do they participate to the matey happy moments, but also do not omit them alone among fluctuations of their life. That is while, acquaintances are only traders who exchange their joyances, knowledge and experiences are. Although, these communications are essential for personal growth, are not reliable completely. To cite an instance, all of teammates in workplace are not necessarily close friends and can be passive competitors. Therefore, extensive relationships with colleagues, classmates, online friends, etc. would not eliminate the requirement to be with a cordial comrade.

Secondly, all people need consideration and if they are not taken care of, they will be devastated. Yea, human beings will have neither mental health nor physical health without the attention of those around them. To illustrate if people do not have self-confidence, they will not improve their abilities, values and talents. At the same time, entire self-esteem of human is tied up with care and regard of others. This instinctive requirement is responded frequently by immediate family and cordial friends. So shallow and sometimes destructive relationship with acquaintances do not provide people's demands and wants.

In conclusion, human beings may be made numerous people aware of during their life, but the number of their close comrade is not so much. Therefore, I think we need friend that who believes in us and gets on well with us. ",Yes,No,Yes,Yes,7
"Along with a global access to the internet network, people do not see studying real scientific and past events much productive.","Along with a global access to the internet network, people do not see studying real scientific and past events much productive. Undeniably, I am of the opinion that there are more benefits of internet-based research methods as a huge reservoir of learning.

Some people opine that pen and pencil based exams are still common as the best way of measuring the learning level of candidate to check if they could move to the next level. In this way, they have to grasp the latest facts in subjects like history and science by memorizing them. These vast information could not be kept in their mind unless get forced by taking some tests.

However, I do not see any benefits in paper-delivered testing systems which are associated with overloading a great deal of information once you get prepared for exams. Having seen where there is a huge range of topics to get memorized, pupils suffer from undesirable panic disorders. If test takers are to enjoy understanding every points in theoretical or practical fields, less pressure must be put on them. Recent records have demonstrated that research-based learning tactics stimulate educators to know the scientific and academic parts better. By checking and browsing more pages regarding the searched-information, our horizons would be opened resulting in improving the efficiency of remembering things without force.

To conclude, nothing wrong is seen with finding the answer of questions attributed with traditional issues or health-related topics. We are living in the era of technology which research is the bedrock of it’s progress, if getting used widely, getting acquainted with every details of studying realities would not be irritating anymore.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,6
Is having creativity important in the 4.0 indistrial era?,"In the 4. 0 industrial era, many industries need right strategies to meet higher efficiency on production, more expansion to new markets, and more competency in the global business. One of those strategies is creating skilled workers, a ready to face human resources, to meet requirements in the 4. 0 industrial revolution. The skilled workers needed because they posses knowledge, skills, and abilities that seek by companies. Furthermore, as demands of skilled workers increase, requirements to meet is also remains challenging. For example, many companies’ today require the workers to fulfill both hard skill and soft skill.

Linkedin reports the importance of balancing both hard skill and soft skill of workers. One of soft skills, a creativity, is becoming a great source of helping employees to do their jobs. Meanwhile, a creativity contributes to develop workers’ careers, the role of it is becoming crucial.

There's no denying that mobile phones have become a great part of our lives, but recent research has proven that they could be quite dangerous if not used properly.

There is no limit to what a phone can do. They enable you to have everything at a grasp of a hand, from communication to task management to develop habits. . . Etc. There are many apps designed to help you, for instance, there are apps that could be used in diet or that can aid you with learning languages, there are ones that facilitates communication and many more. That is all besides having internet that enables you to search whatever you want. Like it or hate it, but smart phones are simply irreplaceable.

Nevertheless, nothing is that good. While phones have lots of perks they prove to be detrimental. They are becoming very addictive; people spend the majority of their day on their phones rather than socializing or going out. You'd find them on their phones even when they are in the company of friends, it's alarming and that's not even half of it. Modern research demonstrates that such devices emit radiations that can harm our brains and bodies. Further studies show that staying for long hours on the phones can weaken eyesight, produce headaches and even stimulate mental illnesses. As a result, some people believe that the government should intervene and restrict mobile ownership. But would that help?

In my opinion, I don't think that restricting phones would do the trick as the government can't control people's behaviour and tendencies. I believe that it's a matter of personal choice; people are free to do what they want. However, the government could still play a role by spreading awareness about proper phone usage and perhaps issue some laws that protect the public like the one prohibiting phone use while driving.

In conclusion, Mobiles are handy devices that we can't do without but considering the consequences that comes along with it one should be careful about how they use them",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7
Should employees focus on their qualities?,"While recruiting a new employee, the employer should pay more attention to their personal qualities, rather than qualifications and experience. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give your opinion and include relevant examples.

Recent decades have witnessed a burgeoning growth of numerous industries; therefore, recruiting the right person for the position is crucial to the development of enterprises. But how do we determine if a person is the best fit? Advocates of conventional recruitment methods opine that this candidate must have sufficient experience and qualifications needed for that job. Nevertheless, some people argue that candidates’ personal qualities cannot be ignored. In my view, both components are of equal importance.

To begin with, the conventional approach of checking potential workers’ qualifications via their resumes, LinkedIn profiles, issued qualifications and certifications from authorised organisations is vital. Apparently, whenever we submit a job application, we are always required to attach a CV while a cover letter is optional. Without a decent qualification, even if that candidate’s personal characteristics are suitable, the enterprise will need to carry out lots of skill trainings eventually. ",Yes,No,Yes,No,6
Does creativity matter to support workers' careers?/,"Many industries need the right strategies to upscale their businesses in the 4. 0 industrial. Those strategies aim to meet higher efficiency on production, expansion to new markets, and competency in the global business. One of the strategies is creating skilled workers, ready to face human resources, to meet requirements in the 4. 0 industrial revolution. As demands of skilled workers increase, requirements to meet also remain challenging. For example, many companies today require workers to fulfill both hard skills and soft skills.

According to Linkedin situs, it is important to balance both the hard skills and soft skills of workers. One of the soft skills, creativity, is becoming a great source of help to employees to do their jobs.

The detailed description about crime in newspapers and on television can affect the people and cause many social problems. Some people say that this should be restricted. Do you agree or disagree?,"In this contemporary era, it is the heated argument that citizens can get influenced by the detailed information about offense give in newspapers and new channels on T. V. Which can lead to plethora of social issues. such as, rape, robbery and deviance. A number of masses reckon that it should be cramped. I am completely disagred with this senerio. In this essay, I will discuss the reasons why I am not with this view with relevant examples.

There are various reasons why this should not be restricted. The effective one is that it aware the society. In other words, by watching and reading about crime. People will get aware from different kinds of criminal activities and get to know the punishment give to person who act that illegal act. They will get the full details that act like how and why. Moreover, Other criminal will also watch that newes and learn the lesson from that news. What it means, T. V channels also show how they punish criminal to act crime which can scared them. Consequently, if they do just small crimes and thinking to do some big offence. They will get scared and will not try to do.

On the flip side, there are a number of people who think that it should be restricted. The main one is that people will get effected by watching such activities. Mostly youngersters will get affected because modern youth like to take risk and do advanceras things. Furthermore, It also effect their relationship with others by watching violent activities they will start getting agreesive and disrespecting their elders. For example, some news channels shown each and every part of the crime and by watching that their brain force them to experience it. Therefore, they get indulge in it slightly and start becaming criminal.

In conclusion, I would like to state that although there are a number of disadvantages of showing detailed information about crime. However, I believe that it is a good way to aware society about crime with reality rather than confusing them by giving small information. ",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7
Global warming is one of the biggest threat to our environment.what causes global warming? What solutions are there to solve this problem?,"In recent years global warming is one of the pressing problem that our environment is facing. The principal cause behind this phenomenon is air pollution and deforestation. However the same can be curbed by using alternative sources of energy and planting more trees. Fundamentally, there are two prominent reasons that can attributed to the increase in global warming. Primary reason is the air pollution caused by public and private transportation. With the increasing number of vehicles which releases harmful gases like carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and methane in the air, these greenhouse gases are the major source of increasing temperature of earth which ultimately results in global warming. Secondly, another reason that contribute to the global warming is deforestation the cutting of the trees leads to release of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. One mature tree absorb as much as 48 pounds of carbon dioxide each year. For example, according to American scientific research, deforestation is responsible for 15 percent of the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Although, there are plenty of ways to solve this problem by taking some possible measures with the coalition of the public and authorities. Chiefly, the public ought to use CNG powered vehicles as natural gas regarded as clear fuel. Government should implement laws to minimize the adoption of current vehicles. For example, in many developed countries number of vehicles decreased and petroleum energy is replaced by CNG. Secondly, as a way to tackle this issue the authority could make the law to protect the remaining forests and new schemes should be placed to promote the planting of trees. Furthermore, government should also launch awareness programs to protect the forest. In conclusion, although the world is suffering from the hazards of increased global warming because of the inclined carbon content in the air and loss of green trees, while the same can be tackled by introducing natural gas over petroleum and by protecting trees. If the state implemented these solutions, the problem can be reduced to a manageable level.",Yes,No,Yes,No,6
"In the modern world, it is possible to shop, work, and communicate online without any face-to-face contact with other people. Is this a positive or negative development?","Nowadays, it appeared an opportunity to interact with society using any device that can provide internet access. This gives people plenty of beneficial opportunities as new inventions make life effortless to live.

One of the major benefits that modern technologies bring is that people can obtain mental and physical relief from everyday routine. People get the opportunity to acquire food, communicate and entertain themselves through internet which is less stressful as there is no society that can have an effect on you. Also, it becomes comfortable to do everything online using any device with an internet connection by making a few simple clicks without wasting time on commuting. Moreover, communication with those who live in another place becomes not only facile as there are no people to judge language knowledge, but need to reach the interlocutor fades into the background.

Another considerable advantage impacts international businesses and companies. It is essential for companies to stay competitive and find professional specialists, and the internet creates an opportunity to hire people. For example, if work efficiency in a company is unsatisfactory due to the poor number of professionals in the area, specialists from different countries become an adequate replacement. Moreover, rent of premises will no longer become part of the expenditures, because online work allows to stay at home and work remotely.

Considering all things together it can be said that present times technologies that allow remote access to everything with no social interactions bring benefits for people as living becomes simple and for businesses by giving opportunities to develop. ",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7
"In many countries, paying for things using mobile phone (cellphone) app is becoming increasingly common. Does this development have more advantages or more disadvantages?","Technology revolution is leading us to the era that never appeared in the imagination of our ancestors, especially modern tap and pay method allows us to buy products with taps of phone onto the POS machine, it is debatable that cashless payment is exposing ourselves on risk of compromising personal privacy and people rather adhere to conventional paper based payment, however using mobile phone to finalize payment seems has more advantages over traditional paper based payment, especially in the sense of lifting the restriction of payment location as well as time saving.

Cashless payment has more advantages over cash payment in terms of cashless payment, in other words, paid by phone or apps allows us to execute the paying behavior online without visiting the vendor in person, for example, paying our utilities bill online is easier, simpler than visiting the governmental facilities physically, in re-shaping of paying method brings great convenience to us and undoubtedly mobile phone will gradually replace cash payment.

Furthermore, cash payment will be overwhelmed by cashless payment due to it saves ample time, paying online enable us to make the payment with few taps on screen rather than queuing in front of counters, for instance, online payment made the grocery shopping less time-consuming as it would simply complete with few click on laptop, whereas cash purchase requires ones to visit and spending time at brick and mortar store, thus online payment has absolute advantage compare to conventional payment method.

To conclude, paying with mobile phone offers us more flexibility on location and save more times, traditional payment has less to offer in this aspect, thus paying with apps has greater advantage than cash, in essence, apps payment is replacing cash in majority fields. ",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7
It is better to have one true friend than all the acquaintances in the world. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"Numerous people would rather have one loyal comrade than have lots of acquaintances around the world. I consent with this preference and think that a true pal is more worth.

First of all, I believe that the intimate mates give their friends a plethora of motivation to overcome fierce time. In fact, not only do they participate in the their matey cheery moments, but also do not omit them alone among fluctuations of their life. That is while, acquaintances are only traders who exchange their joyances, knowledge and experiences. Although, these communications are essential for personal growth, are not reliable completely. To cite an instance, all teammates in workplace are not necessarily close friends and can be potential rivals. Hence, extensive relationships with colleagues, classmates, online friends, etc. would not eliminate the requirement to be with a cordial comrade.

Secondly, all people need real consideration and respect from those around them and if they are not taken care of, they will be devastated. Yea, human beings will have neither mental health nor physical health without the attention. To illustrate, if people do not have self-confidence, they will not improve their abilities, values and talents. At the same time, entire self-esteem of human is tied up with care and regard of others. This instinctive requirement for a happy and healthy life is responded frequently by immediate family and cordial friends. In fact, shallow and sometimes destructive relationship with acquaintances do not satisfy people's vital demands and wants because they have no obligation to befriend us.

In conclusion, human beings may be made numerous people aware of during their life, but the number of their close comrade is not so much. Therefore, I think we need friend that who believes in us and gets on well with us. ",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7
is job salary more important than job satisfaction?,"It is used to be considered that passion to job is not that crucial as huge donation for it. I fully agree with these thoughts and totally understand that job salary is much more privilege than job satisfaction.

First, I truly believe that high salary could bring more successful and safe opportunities to the bright and future than job that I am into. Moreover, I could say that gainful job give much better work promoting. It’s more common variant that person who is working on successful work will live happier life full of things that she or he always wanted to try. On top of that, I hardly believe that huge salary means open doors into carefree and confident life. For instance, well-known businessman and businesswoman’s also chose high income that was predicted from the extreme beginning. Furthermore, in 2017 was made an anonymous psychological vote, which showed that such kind of personalities live their best lives without regret.

Overall, if job brings money you will have the brightest life and bigger basis under your legs.

Secondly, I’m really into thoughts that it doesn’t matter which kind of job are you doing if you have good wage. You could be marketing manager or programmer, doctor or lawyer, it doesn’t play a huge role if you are competent, and for your work you gain high salary. Even if you don’t get enormous pleasure from your job you always can visit courses and a number of lessons that you are really into. Another point is that you will pay for these lessons from your non loved work, but which gives you much more abilities. As it was shown by huge amount of people that kind of work is not that bad like everybody supposes.

Generally, you don’t need to love your profession, on the contrary you should be a good worker as well as for it, you actually gain your money.

In other words, I strongly agree and believe that income job brings more safe and successful future than job with real satisfaction. ",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7

“prevention is better than cure”. Researching and treating diseases is too costly so it would be better to invest in preventative measures. To what you extend do you agree.,"Nowadays huge amount of scientists are into thoughts that prophylactic is more better than healing. Diagnostic and cure of variety illnesses needs much bigger wastes than prevention of measures. I honestly believe that various kinds of new measures would greater impact in our medical science than current diseases treating.

Firstly, I strongly believe that not every treating would help specific people. All way of healing one particular illness in the end could become like a waste of time and person, who had this disease will pass away. I truly can not imagine huge numbers of donations that were spent on such non helpful treatment. Moreover, doctors never could be sure that their purposes of treatment will have success in future.

On the contrary, donation to future dominant healing system, which is preventative measures in all ways is the finest choice. Firstly, only one discovered measure could help in treating thousands of people in different world angles. Although, I am really into thoughts that this experience would cost less than healing one disease. Secondly, I suppose that dying out of human population will dramatically rise down.

Generally, successful future of prophylactic was predicted by scientists and UN few years ago. Also arguments to this decision is presented in this essay.

To sum it up, I would say that on our future prevention of measures would have a huge impact, to be precise, awesome impact. Dying out will fell down and for many years worldwide budget will increase at least for 20%. ",Yes,No,Yes,No,6
"The presence of technology in the classroom has become more and more apparent and offers students tremendous resources with which to supplement their education. Given time, technology will completely replace the traditional teacher in the classroom. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?","Technology has been increasingly used throughout the world. This is very apparent in classrooms today. It is disagreed that technology will replace teachers in the classroom. This will be proven by analysing how teachers can cater to the needs of their students as well as motivate and discipline them.

A very important aspect of teaching is the ability of the teacher to shape their teaching style to the needs of their students, as an example, if students in any given class are having trouble understanding a classroom topic, the teacher can rephrase the topic and deliver it in a more effective way, a computerized teacher would be less in-tune with what students require and thus would be incapable of doing this, as a result, technology will not replace teachers.

Motivation and discipline are key to a student`s academic success in the classroom. This is very apparent when teaching children as children require more motivation and discipline to be taught effectively, a technology-based teacher simply cannot accomplish this as certain situations require judgement as to whether a student is acting in an inappropriate manner. After analysing this, it is clear that teachers will always be needed in the classroom.

Following the analyzation of a teacher`s ability to cater to students as well as their capability of guiding students toward success, it is clear that technology will never replace teachers in the classroom. Further, it is expected that technology will act as a supplement to teachers and aid them in instructing their pupils. ",Yes,No,Yes,No,6
People prefer to do business rather than working in an organisation,"In this present time people generally focuses to set up a new business rather than being employed under any employer in any firm.

There are many individuals who usually prefers to work freely by setting up a business. For example- A person can start a students on his own as it will give him satisfaction to work whenever he feels like and even the income is on daily basis so an individual need not to wait for a whole month to receive his salary. Individuals can use his innovative ideas, plan and take decesion for his business.

However there are people who still prefers to work under someone for guidance. For instance a candidate joins a firm to understand a work place, gain knowledge and experience so that he/she can always reach to a higher level and even there are various opportunities such as employees provident fund, health insurance policy, travelling tour packages etc allowances are also provided in an organisation.

"Some people say that because we can now watch films on our phones, there is no reason to go to the cinema. Others say that films should be seen in a cinema in order to be fully enjoyed. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","Technology has brought in a luring twist in this fast-paced world. A section of society is convinced that movies can be enjoyed on our phones and tablets and there is no need to go to the theatre. Whereas, others tend to differ from this thought, as they believe that films are ought to be watched in a cinema for enjoying the same completely. In my opinion, I agree with the latter school of thought.

The principal rationale for going to a cinema is to enjoy it fully while it is released and I agree. Firstly, the positive impact that audience attains after watching a movie on the big screen is immense, which make them satisfied. For instance, one of the studies conducted by the World Movie’s Council demonstrated that ninety percent of the viewers are happy when they experience a motion picture in cinemas. Secondly, the movie watchers get a real-time experience, which makes them satisfied to the core. As a result, watching movies on cinema enables people to be happy and satisfied.

On the other hand, the usage of phone or tablets can replace cinema. One reason, these gadgets are user-friendly and can be accessed anytime and anywhere. For example, one of the surveys conducted by the US film industry illustrated that thirty percent of people opt to watch films on their home devices due to its easy access. Another reason for laying movies at home is cost effective, which allows everyone in the family to watch films anytime and also multiple times. Consequently, watching motion pictures on electronic devices not only restricts monetary encumbrance, but also easy to access.

In conclusion, my strong conviction is that movies can only be fully enjoyed in cinema rather than at home, which make the audience happy and self-contained. Therefore, the public should be physically present in the theatre to enjoy the movie thoroughly. ",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7
Is social media harmful or useful for young people? Explain your opinion. Use reasons and examples.,"Social media is almost an everyday must’ve in today’s world. It has dominated the world to such an extent that living without it has become impossible. Social media, where most people admire it as a revolutionary invention, some people seems to take it as a negative energy on the society.

Firstly, unlike any other invention on this planet over usage of anything may have extreme side effects both physically and mentally. Mostly used by teenagers and young adults, social media isn’t left out from the squad. It has become an unsafe, addictive and negative tool. Speaking to strangers, cybercrime and bullying have peaked up since the invention of social media. Platforms such as Instagram and Facebook contributed in peaking up the suicide rates due to harassment.

In contrast, I believe that social media has paved a way to endless opportunities, it has created jobs like digital marketing, social media marketing, making business easier. Additionally, social media is a real power in today’s world, giving voice to millions of people around the world who’ve used this platform to make some revolutionary changes.

all cars that burn fossil fuels should be banned and electric crs should replace them. Do you agree or disagree?,"It is considered that most of the automobiles should be prohibited and electricians should be used instead of her vehicles. This essay agrees on that electric cars should be more in use in daily life. Some possible reasons are E. V are ecofriendly and cheaper consumptions in daily life.

To begin with, electric vehicles are very much essential for our environment. Because these automobiles are eco-friendly. That means they do not emit harmful smoke from inside of them. And by choosing to drive E. V you are helping to reduce our pollution. An EV car has zero exhaust emission. Moreover, reduced harmful smoke is good news for our health as well. And better air quality to less health problems. And E. V are also quieter as compared to petrol/diesel engines, are result there will no noise pollution.

Secondly, utilization of EV in our daily routine, cuts down our cost to a great extent. Such as expenses like no consumption of petrol, no maintenance cost. As we all now diesel is very expensive so with E. V we can recharge our batteries easily even at home or by solar energy as well. These cars are getting popularity in U. S and there is majority of people shifting towards these electric vehicles. Moreover, electricity to charge an E. V works out around a third as much per km as buying petrol for the same vehicles. However, these automobiles have low servicing cost because there is no maintenance of exhaust systems, radiators, starter motors and many more other parts that are not required.

However, I partially agree to the statement as giving home will benefit people which government should do so, but there should be a minimum charges that everyone should afford to pay. To begin with, I would like to say that house is indispensable thing and it ensure safety and comfortable feeling. Along with it, House is shelter and protect people from extreme weather conditions such as storm, rain, etc. Moreover, Home is a place where person feel relaxed with family after coming back to home from work, all this are advantages of having own's home; therefore government should provide home to every person. In addition to this, giving houses to people will improve living conditions and status of the country. Although, government should provide home, but there should be minimum price for everyone to pay. . The land and construction material costs a lot and government need support from people in order to cover up expenses. For example, Many state government will be in debt without support from the population of the country. The government should try to make Houses cheaper as compared to market price.

While the author of the reading states that american companies will not follow the same path than international ones did, the lecture affirmed that american companies will adopt the certification, thus contradicting the lecture and giving three reasons.

First of all, according to the reading american consumers are exposed to so much advertising, hence the benefit of publishing in product´s labels that your product is ecofriendly would not be perceived by americans. However the lecture disputes this point by indicating that americans do not give the same attention to every kind of publicity so that americans will value those advertising.

Furthermore, the reading argues that americans prefer price and the certification will increse the final price of good, but the lecture contradicts this statement affirming that when the difference in price is less than 5%, consumers look for ther difference, such as environmental care.

Finally the text says that american companies do not have to be worried about international ones, since they sell all their products in America; however the audio affirms that international companies will entry to America if consumers do not find the kind of products that consumers look for, which are ecofriendly products.

2. There is an increasing trend for people to live alone. What is causing this to happen? Will it have a negative or a positive impact on the society?,"The extraordinary rise of living alone is among the most significant social trends of the modern world. Living alone is ubiquitous in developed, open societies, and this particularly affects health and health care. In my opinion, experiencing one has a negative impact on society.

One possibility is that there is a causal link between living alone, being socially isolated, and feeling lonely. But these are three distinct conditions, and living alone does not necessarily mean experiencing one or both of the others (being isolated or feeling lonely). Overall, the main cause of living alone is the tendency of life, nowadays, people do not get married any more than before. Secondly, individuals often spend more time studying and working, especially in civic. Research shows that Americans who are working as journalists, scholars, health care providers, and business persons usually conflate living alone, feeling lonely, and being isolated, and the result is widespread confusion about each condition.

In more detail, living alone is the consequence of isolation because of physical frailty as well as deaths in their family and friendship networks. Thus, they have smaller social networks and less stable contact with children, and they face heightened risks of isolation if they divorce or become widowers.

The risks of social isolation depend not only on which kind of people, but also on the place people are living. Poor neighborhoods with a robust social infrastructure, busy sidewalks, and these social infrastructures suffered higher mortality rates.

At these points, most policy recommendations for reducing living alone are essential. As the population ages and the number of people aging alone grows, societies throughout the world will need to develop new supportive housing programs and new forms of elderly care. ",Yes,No,Yes,No,6

"Task 2 It is sometimes said that people should be encouraged to get married before they are 30, as this is the best both for the individual and for society. Do you agree or disagree ?","Marriage is an undeniable needs for both male and female. By bonding together for lifetime at suitable age it is blatant truth that society can also get benefit from the couple if the relationship between husband and wife is healthy. I agree with the statement.

To start with the positive side of the essay it is clear that every single thing has it’s proper time. Now a days people are so busy with their carrier they have not that much time to think about the future life partner. They had relations for passing time as I could say they are in live-in to fulfill physical needs which is harmful for the society. Ethics are rarely found in the character of any person in the present world. When they realized their mistak, there will be no time to fixed it up. Late marriage brings them think that their children will grown up late. They haven’t any time to spend quality time with their parents; sons and daughter are so busy with their daily life and going to do the same mistake. Furthermore, parents can't ask any questions to their children which put them in guilty situation.

With respect to marriage and better half, a marriage can be positively set an example for the society. By sharing the same bond with love and support can bring happiness. People are wise enough at the age of 30 that they can make their own decision. By getting marriage sense of responsibility has grown in the personality which can’t be seen any other relations.

Big salary is much more important than job.To what extent you agree?,"While searching for employment, there are myriad of factorsthat are kept in mind like job satisfaction, monthly incomeand working environment. However, it is opined that earninghuge amount of money is extremely imperative instead ofhaving satisfaction at a workplace. Although money plays acrucial role in survival, I do not completely agree withaforementioned view and I will explain why in this essay.

Certainly, there are number of argument in favor ofimportance of salary at firm. The preponderant is the income plays a significant role in fulfilling basicnecessities of life and if someone has higher income, thenthey should easily accomplish their dreams of luxurious lifeThese Days such type of lifestyle gives people opportunityto showcase their status in society. In spite of the luxuriouslife, higher salary frequently insures better future for the familyfor instance, there are number of parents who are merelyworking for long hours to earn huge amount of money, andthey invest that money in providing better education andlifestyle to their children.

Despite the fact that manly provide bright future andbetter life, the idea that at firmbig salary is more pivotal than job satisfaction is completely preposterous. The person who is only working for money, often became victim of the stress whereas the person working by ones will occasionally tired at workplace. These are those people who choose their field by themselves, as a result they are more creative and always try their best for achieving good results for the company. To cite an example. Sundhar Pichai the CEO of the renowned companyGoogle achieves this level of success owing to the fact that he is satisfied: with his feild, and he always states follow your heart, and it isthe only path to success. Therefore, satisfaction of employer is much more crucial as compared to salary. Owing to the fact that it leads to prosperous and successful life.

To conclude, it is definitely a case that essential for better life but to accomplish happiness satisfaction and interest is required. Personally, I believe the working condition that satisfies the mind of a person iscertainly more vital. ",Yes,No,Yes,No,6
The most important consideration when choosing any career or job is having a high income. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"People often argue that having high income jobs is better, in my opinion I feel that satisfaction is better than high income salary. I disagree with having high income.

Firstly, having job satisfaction is more vital than high salary owing to the fact that people who frequently earn high income tend to have more stress and less time to be free but people who are satisfied with their jobs tend to be less stressed and not having to worry too much. For instance, a guy who works in arts and designing is often more happy and less stressed and that gives him a sense offreedomof imagination. In other words, he tends to be less stressed and worried but more creative and satisfied.

In addition, performing or doing what makes you happy leads to productivity and mind growth, people who love their jobs tend to perform and excel better than those who are forced to work for high salaries. For example, JK Rowling had a passion to write stories and novels, now she became the first writer to have a net worth over one billion, she started writing because she loved what she was doing. As mentioned, being passionate and productive is better because you like what you are doing instead being forced what to do.

In brief, having job satisfaction is better than high income because at the end of the day you are not stressed and you will be more happy. ",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7
Under British and Australian laws a jury in a criminal case has no access to information about the defendant's past criminal record. This protects the person who is being accused of the crime. Some lawyers have suggested that this practice should be changed and that a jury should be given all the past facts before they reach their decision about the case. Do you agree or disagree?,"The discussion on hand is about past records of a criminal being available to the jury or not. I disagree with the current law of protecting the criminal.

In my opinion humans are primordial by nature and a lot is said about them from there line of ancestry and previous behaviors patterns which some studies say that sometimes is part of their DNA. To be able to fully justify the verdict on a case, jury needs to confirm if the criminal is committing crimes out of habit.

The said technique may able to bring forth a behavior pattern in case of one and justice be provided according to the criminal history. It could be possible that the criminal needs mental help more than being put in a correction facility or worse.

I understand that the judgement could be colored on basis of the history of the person but that brings me to question my faith in the jurors which I do not want to do. No citizen should have to question the integrity of their judicial system. I would rather believe in their objectivity and sense of justice to provide a judgement to the criminal as necessary or required.

Think of this in this way, when we buy a product sometimes we are so brand specific because we know that the brand ensures a certain quality level and has been around in the market for a long time. So, we know that what we are putting are money on is sound. hence the idea that the criminal's past record being known is like knowing how long and true this person has been in the past and if the person requires something more than just being let go in the society once again, prison or some other facility to help the cause of this person.

"It said that the fast pace of our everyday life, as a direct result of the rapid development of telecommunication technology and the travel industry, has negative effects on individuals, nations, and the globe. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In today's world, the rapid pace of innovation in technology, communications, and travel, has led to dramatic changes in life and made it a fast life. Although these changes make life better in many ways, many, including me, believe that their disadvantages cannot be easily ignored.

The negative impacts of the fast-paced life resulting from the advancement of technology in both people’s interactions and movement, which is moving at an incredible speed, could be portrayed in three different scales; personal, national, and global. On a personal level, first of all, it is a fact that most people are under intense pressure and a lot of mental stress because they have to put tremendous effort into adapting themselves to this speed. Designers, for example, are faced with new gadgets and architectural applications that are introduced one after the other, creating a new challenge for them because they have to be up to date to get or keep their job. At the second scale (communities), it is obvious that family relationships are compromised because of the limited time that their members have to spend together and is accelerated by establishing virtual connections through social media such as Facebook or WhatsApp so many people may experience failed marriage, which is undoubtedly a problem for communities. On a universal scale, there is a myriad of technology-driven flights that not only does contribute to global warming but also increasing noise pollution. Every day, large amounts of carbon dioxide and other gases are being emitted into the atmosphere, which has a major impact on the climate system. Also, those who are close to airports are very affected by noise, they may face some problems such as sleep disorders.

Admittedly, it is true that advances in technology have made it more convenient for us to travel or communicate than ever before. For example, we can be in contact with a friend or family member via a state-of-the-art device even in out-of-the-way areas or be on the move to visit another part of the world. However, this cutting-edge technology has brought with it a whole new set of problems.

In conclusion, it appears that the satisfaction of a modern lifestyle, new experiences through the acquisition of advanced devices should not make us forget the side effects of these changes. We need to grasp the magnitude of the unfavorable effect in order to find effective solutions.

"In many countries, very few young people read newspapers or follow the news on TV. What do you think are the causes of this? What solutions can you suggest?","Electronic devices such as mobile phones and tablets have taken over lives, It is stated by certain group people that they would not be able to survive without these devices. This has majorly affected the younger generation that is finding easy access to them at a very tender age. In certain parts of the world, the use of traditional sources of information like newspaper and television is steadily declining. This essay will list the two main causes of this decline and its solutions.

One of the main causes for this is social media, the explosion of social media on the internet is one of the main reasons that news on other mediums is becoming redundant. For Instance, most people get their information regarding world events from applications such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. Moreover, these platforms allow you to quickly share the information with your peers and start a dialogue about the ongoing events.

The second reason is easy access to electronic devices and lack of parental control on them. Parents today provide children with an electronic device such as a tablet or mobile phone from a young age to keep them entertained. As the child gets used to these devices it is quite hard for them to keep it away and use other sources of information. For example, The New York Times reported that 75 per cent of children around the world have some sort of electronic device that they are addicted to, provided by their parents. The access of these devices from an early age and lack of awareness about other mediums has resulted in a further decline of young people using various other mediums of news.

The following solutions can be applied to tackle the above-mentioned problems. Firstly, parents should restrict the time spends on social media as well as explain it's drawbacks to their wards. This will help a young one understand and restrict their time on social media as well as build interest in other mediums of information around them. Secondly, Adults should not provide their kids with an electronic device and encourage them to read newspapers or watch television to gather information regarding world events. Since newspapers articles are formally written in comparison to their internet counterpart. This activity will improve their reading as well as increase their command of the language.

In my opinion, parents are the biggest influences on their wards reading habits. If an adult restricts access to social media and encourages their young one to read a newspaper or other various sources of information. The decline of these traditional medium especially young people decrease. This activity of reading will improve a child's vocabulary and protect their eyesight. ",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7
Team activities are more beneficial rather than solo activities .To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"People perform various activities in their daily routine. But, it is highly controversial issue that whether team activities have more benefits or solo activities are more beneficial. I corroborate that team activities are more beneficial rather than which are performed alone. Let us deliberate some compelling reasons which will lead towards a logical inference.

To embark on, there are myriad of benefits to shore light upon the group activities. To plunge into, the most intrinsic one is that people learn communication skills and conflict management. To justify, when masses perform in teams then at time they gets chance to learn many things like leadership, adjustment, understanding and so on. when we talk with various types of people without hesitation. At that time individual's confidence boosts. As a result, multitudes gain enough knowledge in different fields because group members have different views. Moving further, folks easily learn to cooperate with other people like human's easily sharing their problems with other team members as well as team members solve their problems. Furthermore, people learn discipline like how to behave with other members. Lastly, People learn various skills like positive thoughts as well as how to share their feelings, emotions and problems with other people.

Conversely, there are some benefits of activities which people perform alone. First and formost reason is that individuals are self dependent. In competitive era, the competition is increasing in the society. So, inhabitants generate their ideas without any assistance. Hence, masses cognitive skills are increasing and their mind is sharp as well as they can concentrate in their studies or work because individuals focus on their own work without any disturbance. Therefore, multitudes complete their work easily and they do not waste their time and there relastic development is increasing.

To sequiter, no doubt people become self dependent and are able to concentrate better in case of solo activities, team activities teach people more skills.",Yes,No,Yes,No,6
"It is said that the fast pace of our everyday life, as a direct result of the rapid development of telecommunications technology and travel industry, has negative effects on individuals, nations and the globe. To what extend do you agree or disagree?","Whether the ever-rising speed of our day-to-day life which arises from the growth of technological telecommunications and travel industry could produce detrimental impacts on the whole world and its inhabitants is a dispute which seems to be debunked on account of this speed’s practicality in creating healthier societies as well as providing them with economic benefits.

One major drive of the impracticality of the aforementioned idea, on the one hand, is that the increased pace of our lives would lead to work-related tasks, which comprise virtually many a person’s whole time nowadays, being performed more quickly inasmuch as these progressions in technology or traveling are of the most viability in case of our working lives. Allotting less time to working, consequently, not only are a lion’s share of individuals capable of strengthening their people-to-people bonds, but they would also have more time for their entertainment. Having work/life balance, in turn, everyone enjoys their mental well-being and a healthier society is expected.

The possibility of gaining economic profits, on the other hand, is of immense benefit. This stems from the fact that the desired result could be yield sooner in view of those improvements irrespective of geographical barriers or time restriction and everything is done more quickly. The amount of time spent in businesses, therefore, would shrink by utilizing developed facilities compared with conventional methods like transporting goods with slow vehicles which is a colossal waste of time or outdated mail posting to name but a few. Should we have to do trades using these ways, the monetary benefit would not be achieved early. Thus, the aforesaid developments would bring about financial profits faster and sooner and enhance the economic level of the society.

In the highlight of the above-mentioned analysis, to recapitulate, the effects of modern life’s speed does not seem to be destructive due to its merits of promoting people’s mental health in addition to facilitating money making. ",Yes,No,Yes,No,6
Some old people today struggle with the use of modern technologies such as smartphones and computers. What is the cause of this? What are some possible solutions?,"As the 21st century continues to unfold, an array of new technologies have arisen, most of which were previously out of the reach of people's comprehension. Computers and cell-phones are patently obvious examples that may cause some elderlies to experience difficulties while using them. Although there are specific root causes related to this problem, effective policies can be adopted to remedy the situation.

There are two main reasons why the old more than others, struggle with keeping abreast of these state-of-the-art gadgets. First and foremost, people over the age of 50 or 60 are "" technology immigrants"". To illustrate, these days, children are born into a fast-changing technological world; they understand even from early ages how to work with these devices; therefore, they called ""technology native"". However, aged people have to acquire the knowledge and skill of using them, exactly like taking in a foreign language. Furthermore, they usually fail to receive sufficient instructions for use from people around, so it is easily perceivable why they prefer to live in an old-fashioned way.

There are, however, some workable solutions to help the senescent how to cope with contemporary society. One step would be education; by planning training schemes, the older adults can be exposed to the technology, so as to learning the skill would be more convenient. By means of these educational courses, which could be a simple video clip, they can determine how user-friendly and effective these gadgets are. Another alternative could be designing specific applications and programs suited to elderlies in order to motivate them.

To recapitulate, it is understandable that getting used to technological devices, barely conceivable a few decades ago, is not trouble-free; however, with the help of education and incentive programs, it is bound to be solvable. ",Yes,No,Yes,No,6
Different kind of crimes increase ? What cause and give solutions?,"There is no blinking at the fact that various sort of crimes increase day bay day. It has a cause and disease which has impact on our society and nation. It has a great social, economy, political and moral problems which destroys whole country and nation. However, in this essay I will discuss some approaches of mine. First and foremost think our country administration system is not good because hig ups leaders behave non seriously and carelessly in important matters and no efforts to check this tendency. Secondly, the illiteracy rate in our has greatly increased. Most of people are illiterate they are unaware of the harmful consequences of this evil. Thirdly, co-operations counts a lot in such matters with government. But our public don't seriously cooperate with the government. The above mentioned causes which damage whole society. I am afraid if no step is taken to control then problems will become more acute and result heavily lose to the whole nation. However, some measures can tackle these problems immediately. First of all, government should check all problems effectively because only strong government can control these kind crimes. Secondly, literacy rate should be increase because only educated people can solve these problems. Thirdly, public must be feel their responsibility they should take interest in the affairs of country. The concept of national consolidation should be lunched. Only national unity which can make future bright and brilliant. To conclude, the above mentioned steps can be eradicate various crimes. When all kind of evils eradicate then our future will be strong, bright and brilliant.",Yes,No,Yes,No,6

"many people seek an international education through studying abroad. what advantages do you believe can be gained from studying abroad and what possible disadvantages do you see? give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","The number of students who have opted to study abroad has grown steadily in the last few years. Receiving formal education in a foreign country has its own positive and negative aspects, but I believe that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.

Some assume that the option of studying abroad has some drawbacks. One of the reasons for this is that receiving foreign education would cost more than getting an education in one’s homeland. Parents continue to spend more money on plane fares, living expenses, as well as tuition fees. Another reason is that students may be inexperienced and dissatisfied with the culture, environment, and language of the destination country. As a result, it might have a detrimental impact on their emotional state and academic performance. Adapting to a different environment also hinders the normal flow of learning for most, and some students might not want to resume their studies for such reasons.

On the other hand, some think that learning in a foreign land brings numerous benefits to the students themselves. Firstly, by studying in another state, students would have the opportunity to learn new languages and foreign cultures. Second, students can learn how to live independently, including cleaning their rooms or doing laundry on their own. Third, they can get acquainted with people from other countries and get familiar with multicultural environments. Finally, it is a fact that in certain countries, the international graduate degree offers additional value while students are searching for occupations.

In conclusion, it is irrefutable that the option of studying abroad has its advantages and disadvantages. Despite all the negatives, I agree that it has more educational benefits for students themselves, which is why students should be motivated to seek an international education. Though tuition fees may be a hindrance, several foreign scholarships are given these days.",Yes,No,Yes,No,6
"Interest in homeschooling is becoming more wipespread around the world. In your opinion, should school be compulsory for all children, or should families be allowed the right to choose to educate their children at home?","Education is always the most actual discussion topic in our world. There is a contrast that whether schools must be obligatory or children can be educated at their homes. Personally, I firmly hold the opinion that schools must be compulsory for every child regardless of his/her financial level.

First and foremost, school atmosphere makes students more extravert and open-minded. It should be noted that group works which demand students to work collaboratively, and students who participated in these projects are more successful in both career and educational life. To cite an example, in the 1980s scientists started a new research about the difference between homeschooled children and students who were educated at school. At the end of the research the results were unbelievable, poor students` marks surpassed well-to-do pupils` scores who were studying with the help of more than 20 teachers. As a result, they decided the main factor which leads to these condition is team works and study-buddy project. When everything is taken into consideration, it is obvious that nothing can be equivalent to school education.

Secondly, schools provide numerous technical facilities and laboratory equipments which are not sold in anywhere, only the government sends it to the schools. There is no doubt that these equipments have a big contribution to the success of lessons. For instance, in California students were attracted to a pilot project. They separated into 2 groups, then the students were thought the same chemical topic, but in different methods. The first group`s teachers educated their pupils in auditory way for 2 hours, contrarily, the second group did only chemical experiments for 15 minutes. At the end of this investigation, despite the time difference, the first group`s scores could not catch the second`s, let alone surpassing the second group. At the end, it proves the proverb ""seeing once is better than hearing 100 times""

To sum up, however families interest abour homeschooling is increasing day by day, nobody can exactly answer that is the homeschooling more efficient than educating in schools. Because of aforesaid reasons, I strongly believe that homeschooling can not provide sufficient education, that`s why, schools must be mandatory.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7
"IN SOME COUNTRIES, IT IS ILLEGAL FOR COMPANIES TO REJECT JOB APPLICANTS FOR THEIR AGE. IS THIS A POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE DEVELOPMENT?","n general, a company requires experienced, hard_working and enthusiastic adults. However, in a few areas around the world, companies are not allowed to refuse employees based on their age. Despite the fact, I think this is a negative development because work vacancies should be given to adults as well as elderly shall be retired and relax for the rest of their lives.

First and foremost l, these industries needs skilled, energetic and smart people to work with them. Who might encourage to the daily growth in the required field, which is only possible if you have workers without limitation in their capacities. For instance, being a representative is merely suitable for the age group of twentieth. Otherwise, the job’s responsibilities cannot be fulfilled. As a result, companies ought to fill job vacancies with deserved applicants.

Furthermore, when a job is given to an old worker, they will need more rest during the period of their duty as elderly might have some health related issues that require regular breaks. Hypertension, for example, is one of the common heart diseases among aged people. Consequently, it will be much better if older ages could spend the remaining of their lives relaxing, improving their health and exercising.

In conclusion, although in some part around the world industries are not permitted in rejecting employees depending merely on their ages. I strongly believe that this is a negative development and elderly need more rest. On the other hand, filling job offers with young and motivated applicants has a positive effect in the growth of the company.

Popular events like the Football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tension and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way.,"Every four years, the whole world stops to watch international sporting events such as the Olympics and the Football World Cup in which athletes show their best performance to make their country proud. These sporting occasions have proved to be helpful in easing international tension in difficult times when powerful leaders were trying to control the world’s economy and other governments were fighting over the land. The Olympic Games are one of the best examples which prove how sporting events can bring nations together, at least temporarily. From the ancient History, when Greeks and Romans would interrupt battles to participate in the games, to the more recent international disputes, when athletes from Palestine and Israel would forget their differences, compete peacefully and even embrace each other after an event. Moreover, these popular events have called the world’s attention to the terrible consequences of wars; thus some leaders have tried to reach agreements to end their disputes and live peacefully.

Similarly, international sporting events show benefits in some developing countries which live in a daily internal civil war. For example, Brazil has a high rate of unemployment, lack of education, hunger, crime, poverty and corruption which leads to an immense embarrassment of being Brazilian and a low self-esteem. However, when the Football World Cup starts, the Brazilian squad, which is considered the best team in the world, provokes an amazing feeling of pride in their country. Most people seem to forget all their problems and even the criminal activity decreases. They paint roads with the national colors, wear the Brazilian team shirts and buy national flags. Moreover, the competition brings families and neighbors together and even rival gangs watch the games and celebrate peacefully.

In conclusion, popular sporting events play an important role in decreasing international tensions and liberating patriotic feelings as history has shown.",Yes,Yes,Yes,yes,7
"As people live longer and longer, the idea of cloning human beings in order to provide spare parts is becoming a reality. The idea horrifies most people, yet it is no longer mere science fiction. To what extent do you agree with such a procedure?","The idea of human cloning is getting popular in these days. No doubt, human cloning has opened new possibilities for medical sector. Although, some people believe that human cloning raises some worrying unethical issues. I personally see the positive side of this invention.

There are many reasons for believing so. First and foremost, In the present time people are aware enough to take care of themselves. They know the value of good diet and exercise that why human life expectancy has increased. Now people live longer than past but in the old age their organs get weaker and they damage quickly so they need replacing. So, in this case human clone can be a blessing for these people. Cloned humans can be used to place their organs as it is hard to find organ donators in present time.

However, a different school of thought, which opposes my stance says that human cloning is an unethical and unreligious concept. Moreover, it is useless to make other human beings and then eventually just kill them for saving other people. Furthermore, killing other human beings for own sake can be considered as a murder or a sin which is acceptable for some people. Some people argue that if it is possible to create other people than no one will die as people would start cloning their died relatives. Hence, I am not surprised to see why some would contest this trend.

From the robust arguments and viewpoints so clearly discussed above, it is only fair to get confused when deciding between the possible sides of cloning human beings but notwithstanding the negatives, the positives are no joke and cannot be ignored. ",Yes,Yes,Yes,yes,7
"In the future, nobody will buy printed newspapers or books because they will be able to read everything they want online without paying","People have the prediction that the paper-backed reading sources will no longer be in demand. The given argument is the possibility of reaching all in need materials via the internet plus free of charge. This essay completely agrees that the future of reading habits will be throughout the internet and for free. Firstly, due to the fact that the internet provides the easiest way of reaching news or books, and secondly, the wide range of sources are offered on the internet.

First, internet access creates large opportunities and provides them easily. Merely by clicking the “search” button in the Google search engine, it is possible to find a number of the book or other resources for reading in less than 1 second with normal internet speed, which means that it is less time-consuming than in libraries or kiosks. For example, in my country nowadays the traditional reading habits of both elderly people and students in universities have changed vastly. Thus, electronic books and digital newspapers are more attractive due to the ease of reaching out.

Second, human-being targets to access more and various categories of information, however, to find a variety of topics at the same places is quite difficult, at least to store all such sources physically is impossible. Although there are a number of reading-houses, shops for magazines and journals in Azerbaijan, and interest in a variety of sectors, the lack of sourcing required information in physical stations encourages society to turn to alternative search ways, which is in-demand on the internet.

All in all, the ongoing trend shows that digitized readings are getting more demanded than traditional ones. This essay again proves why to spend money on readings if everything is available on the internet and even no requirements to pay for. ",Yes,Yes,Yes,yes,7
"Nowadays, not enough students choose science subjects in university in many countries. What are the reasons for this problem? What are the effects on the society?","It is irrefutable fact to that the number of science is shrinking in majority of cities in different countries. This trend may have caused due to vivid reasons. The upcoming paragraphs will analyze some explanations for this situation as well as its influence on the society.

There can be two crucial factors that contribute to the popular disinterest in science as a subject. To commence with, science subjects often require a lot of hard work and patience to score average grades, having such patience may prove challenging for many, especially when most of the non science students are indulged in leisure activities. Furthermore, employment opportunities science field has is limited and extremely competitive. For example, after devoting five years in graduation, there is a need to specialize further in some particular science subject to get good and highly paid job. This may discourage many students and thereby it may refrain the students from choosing science as their preferred subject.

Consequently, the results are manifold of this aforesaid trend, as, if there is no admission in science subject, there will be a scarcity of human resources in science field. For example, if there is no one studying science, there will be a deficiency of expert medical practitioners or surgeons; this could create an imbalance in the society. Moreover, if there is no new practitioners or scientists formed, there will be an adding of pressure on the current practitioners and this is not a very favorable condition for the society.

To recapitulate, I would reckon that, extended hard work and study pressure is making students alienated from science subjects, this trend can create serious imbalances in the contemporary society. ",Yes,Yes,Yes,yes,7
"Some young people prefer to leave school at 16 or 18 to get a job, while others feel that there are more advantages to entering university after finishing their school education. What are the advantages and disadvantages of leaving school at 16 or 18 to work instead of going to university?","some young gives preference to leave the school at the age of 16 and 18. many reasons are available to leave the school at the age of 16 orm 18. But here we will discuss some major. Accordind to my point of view, the major reason is poverty. Because some parents cannot afford the expences of the study. So due to it youngers gives preference to leave the study at the age of 16 or 18.

They gives the preference to work for earn the money.

The second reason is this some students are not intelligent in studies. There students just waste money and time, so due to it students also leave the study and go to the work.

But you know everyone have different thinking. some students thinks after completing the school and high school studies it is easy to entering in the university because when students complete the studyof schools and colleges then they get easily admissions in universities. Because this is very beneficial for the students when students complete the university level education then they get easily good jobs.

Now we will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of leaving school at the age of 16 or 18 instead of going to university. Its clear which people thinks the money is everything instead of studies, so for there people this a very good advantage, And those people which cant afford the studies expences for these people this is also a good advantage because their children can earn the money in the early age after leave the school.

Now we will discuss the disadvantages. First of all when young people leave the study on the school level. They face many harmful criteria. For example when they go to work in early age, then they will met many uneducated peole which is not good for a younger. Becuase when this young spend most of his time with uneducated people then automatically he will learn the activities and behaviour of the uneducated peopl also he will follow the bad way of talking, of uneducated people. Also he will lose his studies. You know education is very important for every person. If we dont have education we are good person and we are not good citizen.

Also when young guy earn money in the early ages automatically he will fall in many harmful diseases. For example he will addicts of smoking and also he can drink wine and also mnay more disease he can face.

According to my point of view. Education is very important for everyone. You know nothing is easy and also mohting is not impossible. In every situation we should complete our studies. If our parents cant afford our study expences, we can do a part time job and we can afford our expenses byself. so I think it is easy and every student can do it. It is the best way to complete the study.",Yes,Yes,Yes,yes,7
Some people choose to eat no meat or fish. They believe that this is not only better for their own health but also benefits the world as a whole.,"It is the fact that, some people prefer not to consume any kind of fish or meat, as they believe that, being vegeterian has benefits for their health and also for the world as a whole. To a certain extend, I would agree with this opinion, but I think people should also consume meat or fish in a proportional portion. Thus, meat and fish contain rich ingredients and vitamins which are needed by human's body.

For the many reasons, people choose not to eat fish or meal. They act on the basis of scientific facts. Thus, meat and fish may cause different type of chronic diseases such as heart attack, cholesterol, cancer, obesity.

Moreover, demand on meat and fish is gradually increase. On this perspective, we would face negative problems that which may cause perpetual damages on our planet. Numerous types of fishes would extinct and it would make imbalance in the sea ecosystem.

On another aspect, being vegeterian is one of the ways to protest the policy of governments about slaughtering animals and fishes in order to avoid environmental issues.

However, another reason of no eating meat or fish is related some ethical values, which this communities prohibit to eat bıth of food sources for the such reason that, is inappropriate their certain values and rules. Somehow, they believe that, animals are just like the human being that should be respected as well as preserve their lives.

As consequence, It is reality that, being vegeterian has many utilities for our health and positive impact for environment. I agree with this approach. But, in my opinion, all species exist for each other. How the animals need each other for living, people also may consume the farm animals or fishes. Because we may obtain the certain types of nutrition from animals. But also, I believe that, if we keep the balance to consumption of meat, fish, vegetable, this would make our body more healthier than to become vegeterian. ",Yes,No,Yes,No,6
It is accepted that genetic engiineering is a significant topic in recent times.,"It is accepted that genetic engiineering is a significant topic in recent times. Some people argue that it has lots of benefits on developing human’s life while it is doubted by others that it may be caused some danger. From the point of my view, the first aspect is true and this topic will be very useful for us.

Many diseases have been proven to be of genetic origin as a result of studies which conducted for many years. Genetic engineering has reached so important position with these studies. Because genetic researches has made possible to find proper cure and medicine for lots of diseases. As improved the research stage, the human and different life organism’s genetic maps have formed. Integration and relation between these diverse organism have been offered, then benefits and harms have determined to eachother.

On the other hand, genetic enginneering ensures to prevent negatory which possibility may arise in the future on human body. Almost all illness and disorders able to discover on unborn chidren. Children’s parents genotype can demonstrate their future child’s problems. After these detection, unborn child’s genetic code can treat and fixed before they born. At the same time, this situation give chance to abortion right to their parents if these children have insoluble disease.

In conclusion, even if genetic engineering has a multiside power which can use for benefit or harmfull strategic plans, its definitely clear that it’s benefits on all life organism are vital. ",Yes,No,Yes,No,6
People all around the world take into account the significance of genetic engineering.,"People all around the world take into account the significance of genetic engineering. Although it is sometimes thought that it has numerous benefits to humanity, others are of the opinion that it could bring destruction to the ecosystem. However, my opinion on that issue is that both negative and positive effects of genetic engineering should be carefully researched and then should be used for the greater good of humanity.

There are certain factors of the genetically engineering products. Firstly, crop modification will bring resistant to various plant diseases and it also targets infestation of unwanted insects. In other words, the amount of pesticides and fertiliser used are reduced. Furthermore, many countries are producing genetically engineered crops to produce a good variety of plants and abundant harvest. Genetic engineering can also address the increased food demands of people around the globe. Many diseases that human genetically inherits can be fought against with the improvement of genetic engineering and it can also ensure a generation.

However, some people argue that it brings long-term effects to humanity and environment. Certain reasons for these are the concerns of human health in which most modified foods contain toxins that are harmful to us. Also, it produces a minimal amount of nutrition. Another major concern is the potential harm to the environment- once genetically modified organisms are released into the wild, it interbreeds with the native organism and creates new species that may not be desirable.

Finally, in my view, it is essential to look at the positive side it brings to humanity. As the population grows, the demand for food supply is increasing, thus, the natural method cannot cope the demand of the people. In this way, scientific way of plantation and farming are fundamental in our environment. Many diseases that cause death to a large number of people could be prevented using the blessing of genetic engineering.

In conclusion, there are good arguments for and against genetic engineering, so people must continue to research various methods to minimise the negative side effects of engineering products to ensure the betterment of every individual in the future.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7
"Some young people prefer to leave school at 16 or 18 to get a job, while others feel that there are more advantages to entering university after finishing their school education. What are the advantages and disadvantages of leaving school at 16 or 18 to work instead of going to university?","People who leave school at 16 or 18 thinks it's good to job instead of doing further study. Some of the students dont have the resources to go for further studies, so they are forced to leave study behind and start doing job while the students who want to study more and more is like investment the more they study the more they are likely to get a carefully paid job. The advantage of leaving study or school at 16 or 18 is you can be more professional in the society rather than the kid who tries to continue the study. whereas the disadvantage of leaving study behind could not make the student more ethical or good in a society. The thing is our society is like the more you have studied the more you will get respect. While advantage of continuing the study will give you much respect in society and ethics of being in a Genetic and the disadvantage is like you still have to depend on your father or family for further studies unless you are doing a part time job to carry on your studies. In my opinion, one should carry his studies and do a part time job for himself.

"Health experts believe that walking is a a good exercise for health. However, people are walking less nowadays. why is this happening? How can people be encouraged to work more?","Doctors think that walking is a good for maintaining a good health. However, people are working less in these days. There are many reasons why people shun walking. nevertheless people can be motivated by various ways such as awaring by the government.

On the one hand, people have a lack of time in earlier days. They have become workaholic. People main motive to earn money. As compared to past days people become lazy. They use their mobile phones from morning to evening. For example, news of is a world's busiest City. Although, people of New York city is rich, they are not fit and fine. As a result, there are obese and suffered from dangerous diseases.

On the other hand, through the awareness campaigns human beings encouraged to walk more. government should organiseto health camps, constructs parks and jogging tracks. In this way people know about the advantage of walking. Walking makes people to healthy. community leader should we teach to human beings advantages of walking and exercise. people are encouraged to less use of social media by government programs. for instance, in major cities government has constructed parks. People can visit there for walking. As a result, masses can away from diseases and they become fit and fine.

smoking and alcohol consumption are injurious to health then why does the business of tambaku and liquor still continue?,"Undoubtedly, cigarettes and alcoholic drinks has been impacting on our health due to the consumption of others. As we know these hamper not only mankind, but also environment. Thus, by viewing this, masses arise questions, like if these substances were so harmful then why this would not be banned. In the following paragraphs, I will explore the reasons behind the consumption and why these items are still sell in market.

On the one hand, people are taking these drugs due to addiction and for their happiness. First and foremost, folks think, especially youngsters, they look smart by taking liquid and tobacco. It is certainly true that these are the stress buster buster activities and people often forget their worries and tensions by having this. But when individual were consume more drugs, it would lead to accident and manifold health present problems, such as brain Tumor, cancer and many more and after a while one person addicted towards these activities.

On the other hand, social acceptance and provide employment to citizens are the significant reasons of continuing this field. Primary, banning on strong drinks and on nicotine are impossible, because junk food also impact negatively on mankind's body. But an authority could not Ban fast food as folks love to take this food. Just like junk meal these drugs are also the individual's own choice. Having know their dangerous results masses socially accepted these items. Apart from that, the companies who are making these items has been imparting jobs to manifold labours, which improve the quality of society. Therefore job opportunities and welcoming nature of society towards tobacco and alcohol, thereby still continue the business.

In conclusion, although it is individual option, but it impacts on others health also. Thus, I believe that it should be prohibited in public places.",Yes,No,Yes,No,6
Does your personality change as you get older?,"There is an heated debate about whether our personality changes over years or not. Personally, I agree with this statement and in this essay, I will give valid arguments to support my view.

First of all, I believe there are several factors and situations that we meet during the years, ranging from meeting new people to gaining new experience, that affects our personality. One of the most significant arguments is certainly the new experiences and emotions that we obtain and feel, that might completely change our perspectives and as a result, our personality. For instance, an extrovert and placid child may face such challenges as school pressure or family disaster, which will negatively affect his personality by making him more abrasive and introvert person. Moreover, such situations can also provide us with valuable knowledge and experience that can change personality. Thus, if a person belives he has trustworthy friends but they betray him, he becomes less gullible person.

Furthermore, I can not deny the fact that new acquaintances, that we meet during years, with their different characters and personalities can change our worldview and temperament. By making new friends, we learn range of important aspects, such as importance of sharing and being kind to each other. Thus, I believe new friends that we make as we grow up can change a person from shy and slightly egoist to friendly and communicative friend.

To conclude, I believe that it is almost inevitable that our personality will change over the years, as we face numerous challenges and meet new people that provide us with new experiences. ",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7

As a result of this, many believe that smok should not be allowe in public places. Although there are arguments on both sides, I strongly agree that a ban is the most appropriate course of action.

In my point of view, we are all responsoble about our healt. And we should take care about our bodies.",Yes,No,Yes,No,6
Children who are brought up in families that do not have large amounts of money are better prepared to deal with the problems of adult life than children brought up by wealthy parents. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion,"Experience and learning in child hand decide the mentality and motivation of someone to be better. Society claim that childrens are excessively indulged in rich families and don't learn the inspits important lessons to meet potential struggles. I firmly believe that teaching your child from young age will have impact no matter the financial status.

Starting with childs in middle or low-income families approach struggles and some of them learn how to avoid and tackle it. On the contrary, children who have background a rich background will rarely face struggles and more likely their parents taught them how to approach it. For instance, many children who score the highest in school are either from low or middle class family but the rich children are taught not to work for money instead money works for them. I believe that parents and school should teach how to deal with dut problems whether it's taxes or how to face life.

In conclusion, society and individuals to face with prabhas easier but I disagree and titan believe that people with good mentors and parents will determine how the child deals with problems. As mentioned, no matter what the financial status of the child whither its rich or poor teaching the children how to face the problem of adult life because it is a vital aspect in the child's mental health and development. Also past problems can impact of how the child deals with adult life or it could be a problem the children family experienced. ",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7
"In the past, most people used to travel to their place of work. With increased use of computers, the internet and smart phones, more and more people are starting to work from home. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this development?","With the invention of the internet, our lives are facilitated in ways that were never imagined previously. The inclusion of computers and smartphones in our daily lives has brought many pleasant experiences as well as some problems.

Firstly, computers and smartphones have enabled us to work from home which is very helpful for people who have no one to take care of their children at home. Also, these advancements have provided workers with the opportunity of applying for jobs, in other countries far away from their place of living. Moreover, this globalization has given workers the advantage of flexible working hours without discomfort while sitting in their own homes. For instance, during Covid 19 outbreak worldwide, working from home has been an alternative to abide by the rules of social distancing to avoid virus spread.

The main disadvantage of working from home is the lack of social interaction, which in many cases can affect the psychological well-being of workers. While flexible timings are an advantage but in many circumstances, people find it difficult to meet the deadlines due to several distractions at home. A viral video of a politician constantly interrupted by his son during an interview is a great example to show how the cozy and comfortable environment of the home can turn into a major distraction.

To conclude, I think a peaceful environment with flexible working hours is as important as a social circle to maintain one's mental health. Thus, the best solution is to provide adjustable working hours with a few days to work at the job place and a few days to work at home.

the declining in otter populations,"The reading and the lecture are about the declining in otter populations. While the reading suggests that pollution is the main responsible for the decrease in the number of otter, the lecturer argues that predators are accountable for the otter´s disappearence. The audio casts doubt on the main points made by the reading by providing three relevant reasons.

First of all, the reading states that pollution along Alaska decreased the otter population, but the lecture affirms that predators, are the responsible for the lack of otter. First, the reading supports its theory by affirming that the increasing levels of chemicals in the zone killed other sea mammals, the lecturer, the lecturer refutes this point by arguing that there is a lack of otter´s bodies in the ocean so that predators are a better explanation.

Furthermore, the reading mentions that hunters prefer larger animals; However, the lecture shows that, given the lack of whales, preyers eat otters. Finally, the reading believes that the uneven decline in some Alaskan locations is because of pollution, but the lecturer explain that otters are more accesible than orcas to some places, and that´s why the uneven pattern exists.

In short, even though the reading and the lecture are about the same topic, they mantain different points of view about the responsible for the declining in the otter populations. The lecture effectively challenged the three main reasons given by the reading. ",Yes,No,Yes,No,6
Most people do not care enough about environmental issues. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"A majority of people do not pay attention to the increasing environmental problems. In my opinion, the environment does play a major role in one’s life but unfortunately, most of the people arround us do not pay attention to it.

Global warming is a major issue which has been left ignored over the years and is now impacting our lives badly. A vast variety of people are unaware of the term global warming, its causes as well as its solutions. The extremes of the temperature that we are facing nowadays is a result of this increasing global warming whose major cause is deforestation, which can be resolved simply by promoting trees implantation but little effort has been put into this matter. ,

Another reason of this ignorance towards our surroundings is that most of the people are unaware of the significance of environmental issues and have no idea what these problems can lead to. A survey conducted in Toronto in 2010, shows that 70% of the people were unaware of the tern environmental issues and were subsequently unaware of its causes Iif people are made aware of the term environment and the importance of keeping safe surroundings than we can surely tackle these problems over a little period of time.

In my point of view, although these environmental issues are affecting our day to day life but only a few people are aware of it. A little effort can resolve these issues, by highlighting the importance of a clean and healthy environment. The conductance of seminars and teaching environmental sciences in schools and universities can increase the awareness in people regarding this issue and thus can lead to a better and safe environment.

the declining in otter populations,"The lecture and the reading are about the solar energy as a new kind of renewable energy. While the reading supports the idea that people should switch from fossils fuels to solar energy, the expositor analyze the three main reasons that are used by the reading to support its opinion.

First of all, the reading says that people shoud switch solar energy in order to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels, which are non-renowable. However the lecturer contradicts this statements by explaining that solar planels are made of fossil fuels.

Furthermore, the reading states that solar energy does not have the pollution aspect that non-renewable energies do. On the other hand the lecture affirms that there are more uses of energy than available solar energy. Finally, the reading arguments that solar energy is cheaper than any other kind of energy, and the expositor supports that statement by giving the amazing tax benefits and the opportunity to sell solar energy surpluses.

Some old people today struggle with the use of modern technologies such as smartphones and computers. What is the cause of this? What are some possible solutions?,"As the 21st century continues to unfold, an array of new technologies have arisen, most of which were previously out of the reach of people's comprehension. Computers and cell-phones are patently obvious examples that may cause some elderlies to experience difficulties while using them. Although there are specific root causes related to this problem, effective policies can be adopted to remedy the situation.

There are two main reasons why the old more than others, struggle with keeping abreast of these state-of-the-art gadgets. First and foremost, people over the age of 50 or 60 are "" technology immigrants"". To illustrate, these days, children are born into a fast-changing technological world; they understand even from early ages how to work with these devices; therefore, they called ""technology native"". However, aged people have to acquire the knowledge and skill of using them, exactly like taking in a foreign language. Furthermore, they usually fail to receive sufficient instructions for use from people around, so it is easily perceivable why they prefer to live in an old-fashioned way.

There are, however, some workable solutions to help the senescent how to cope with contemporary society. One step would be education; by planning training schemes, the older adults can be exposed to the technology, so as to learning the skill would be more convenient. By means of these educational courses, which could be a simple video clip, they can determine how user-friendly and effective these gadgets are. Another alternative could be designing specific applications and programs suited to elderlies in order to motivate them.

To recapitulate, it is understandable that getting used to technological devices, barely conceivable a few decades ago, is not trouble-free; however, with the help of education and incentive programs, it is bound to be solvable. ",Yes,No,Yes,No,6
should school be compulsory,"Education is always the most actual discussion topic in our world. There is a contrast that whether schools must be obligatory or children can be educated at their homes. Personally, I firmly hold the opinion that schools must be compulsory for every child regardless of his/her financial level.

First and foremost, school atmosphere makes students more extravert and open-minded. It should be noted that group works which demand students to work collaboratively, and students who participated in these projects are more successful in both career and educational life. To cite an example, in the 1980s scientists started a new research about the difference between homeschooled children and students who were educated at school. At the end of the research the results were unbelievable, poor students` marks surpassed well-to-do pupils` scores who were studying with the help of more than 20 teachers. As a result, they decided the main factor which leads to these condition is team works and study-buddy project. When everything is taken into consideration, it is obvious that nothing can be equivalent to school education.

Secondly, schools provide numerous technical facilities and laboratory equipments which are not sold in anywhere, only the government sends it to the schools. There is no doubt that these equipments have a big contribution to the success of lessons. For instance, in California students were attracted to a pilot project. They separated into 2 groups, then the students were thought the same chemical topic, but in different methods. The first group`s teachers educated their pupils in auditory way for 2 hours, contrarily, the second group did only chemical experiments for 15 minutes. At the end of this investigation, despite the time difference, the first group`s scores could not catch the second`s, let alone surpassing the second group. At the end, it proves the proverb ""seeing once is better than hearing 100 times""

To sum up, however families interest abour homeschooling is increasing day by day, nobody can exactly answer that is the homeschooling more efficient than educating in schools. Because of aforesaid reasons, I strongly believe that homeschooling can not provide sufficient education, that`s why, schools must be mandatory.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7

The biggest concern in today’s world is pollution and environmental waste.,"The biggest concern in today’s world is pollution and environmental waste. As countries are progressing and become wealthier environmental problem are growing day by day which cannot be neglected. I totally agree with statement.

First of all, in developing countries pollution is the main problem for the atmosphere. To become richer state, country depend on their industries which eventually create the industrial waste. Moreover, poor infrastructure also cause not only ecological but also effect the healthy environment. For instance, a research is conducted by university of Mumbai, 60% of total environmental issues is created by industries which include pollution and other toxic waste.

Secondly, the effect of pollution and environmental issue on human health is so dangerous that it cannot be avoided. The smog atmosphere generated the toxics in air which increase the diseases of lung and throat. Moreover, it not only effect humans but other species on this planet. In last few years, we have seen that large number of dead fishes are coming on shore of oceans around the world. This situations become the eye opener for decision maker of developing countries. For example, in mid 90s London face the smoky and fog weather which effects the health of senior citizen and children. Eventually, this weather cost many lives which makes the policy maker and other streak holder to think about this and takes major steps to dispose the industrial wastage as well the air pollution.

"Labour-saving devices such as dishwashers and communication tools such as computers are supposed to make our lives easier. However, some people argue that these devices only make them more difficult. Does modern technology reduce or increase stress? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. You should write at least 250 words.","It is undeniable that modern technology has brought various kinds of labour-saving devices such as communication tools and dishwashers. Although contemporary generation people lives become easier by using these devices, some elderly individuals think that these devices make their lives more complicated. I believe advanced technology is suitable for young generation people because saves a lot of time as well as it reduces stress.

To begin with, the young generation people are often depending on advanced technology. This is because it saves time and energy; they do not require to put a lot of pressure. For instance, if we use washing machines to wash clothes, they do this work within a few minutes without wasting our energy. As a result, people can get a lot of time for themselves to do leisure activities and spend with their family members.

However, older generation people are not familiar with these electronic devices and they often face difficulties to use them. As they are unfamiliar with this new equipment, this may create a lot of stress for them. Therefore, they would prefer to do things manually. For instance, a survey conducted by the Delhi University found that more than 59% of elderly people refused to use of electronic gadgets such as mobiles and computers. Hence, it is a completely personal choice.

In conclusion, for the contemporary generation, it may reduce their stress and saves time. In contrast, the older generation people believe that it gives them more stress due to their unfamiliarity with these devices. ",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7
"Over the years, technology has become easier and more efficient to help incorporate into our everyday lives and that include social interacting.","Over the years, technology has become easier and more efficient to help incorporate into our everyday lives and that include social interacting. Communicating through using modern technologies has become one of the main aspects of everyones lives and thus it is important to foresee how it can impact relationships and if it is a positive and negative, because is technology really important for communicating these days? This essay will try to answer the question and also talk about how relationships has changed due to technology but also how it can be exploited for crimes to be preformed.

Technology has amplified the social interactions an individual can have which in return has pushed many people into relationships whether it being superficial or a very trusting one. Technology has improved the communications between people due to how easy it became to generally talk to people and how easy it is to convey feelings to other individuals. For instance, social media found in many technologies became the most popular platform for socializing with various people and thus allowed relationships to be formed through using the internet. Another good example is that texting overall became the number one form of communication between people due to how easy it is to write one's feelings and emotions especially to people that have social anxiety. Furthermore, technology has been the reason of many new relationships but that does not mean that those formed relationships can be classified as good or as healthy.

With technology being the main source of socializing in the 21st century, there has been an increase of negative impact it had with creating relationships. Technology has become an outlet for people to interact without the need of knowing one's identity and thus it can become quite dangerous especially to young adolescents. To illustrate, there has been many cases of crimes being conducted through interacting with strangers online where people could lie about their identities, and so many crimes such as kidnapping and human trafficking has increased and became easier due to the introduction of technology. So, everyone should be careful on who they are interacting with and what information is being shared.

In the end, technology still is important for communicating and forming relationships due to how easy social interactions became along with how simple people could talk with each other without disclosing personal information. Although it became a stable in our lives, it still has a negative impact where there has been a series of crimes initiated through using technology. ",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7
Nowadays many people have access to computers on a wide basis and a large number of children play computer games. What are the negative impacts of children playing computer games and what can be done to minimize the bad effects?,"People use computers more extensively these days than ever before, and it is so widespread in our modern world that even children have access to these devices for playing games or watching videos. This essay discusses the disadvantages of playing digital games on computer devices by youngsters and suggests some measures to reduce such negative effects.

Concerning the adverse impacts of young children playing video games, the most devastating one is the addiction these games create. Millions of dollar are spent to make computer games so that they attract a large number of audience and keep them glued to the computer screens. So they are addictive by design and this obsession hampers children's outdoor activities, studies and even time to socialise and learn important life skills. Many research works suggest that children who spend many hours playing computer games end up performing poorly in schools and avoid social events and outdoor activities. This results in physical and psychological issues including poor eyesight and despair. Moreover, violent games cloud the youngsters' judgement and make their rational thinking unstable. Oftentimes, youngsters who play violent games develop violent behaviours.

To minimise the severity of these negative impacts, parents must monitor what their children are doing, especially on computers. They should not be allowed to play computer games more than a couple of hours each week and parents can actively take part in those games with their children so that it becomes family time. Children's outdoor activities should be taken seriously and parents should take them out whenever possible. Finally, parents can use parental control on the digital contents and games their children watch or play. This would deter children from downloading and playing games that are not suitable for their age.

To conclude, computer games, when played excessively by children, have many detrimental effects. Proper parenting and monitoring seem like the best solution to solve these problems. ",Yes,No,Yes,No,6
Some people think internet has advantages while others think it has disadvantages to some extent do you agree or disagree?,"It's undoubtedly true internet has changed our life completely. It has put impact on all things. However, in this essay I will discuss a number of approaches and my opinion too.

On the one hand, internet has become a vital part of people life. And it put a great affect especially on communication so no distance no longer problems. Besides, due to internet business men can do their office work at home or at anywhere. They can do international meetings online through video call. Even students can take video lessons through Skype, video call etc.

In addition, internet has lots of benefits than disadvantage. In today's people can do shopping through internet as much as they want. And there are lots of social media sides which give a opportunity to make new friends and can share their good information on various apps.

On the other hand, internet has some drawbacks such as people become too lethargic because they completely depended on internet even they don't do their simple work. Children also have become addictive of internet they don't give proper attention to their education because they play electronic games as well as interact with strangers without consider harmful consequences.

From my perspective, i personally believe all things which have introduced yet till have some pros and cons thus, internet has some benefits and drawbacks.

"In some countries, celebrities earn higher salaries than senior politicians. What are the reasons? Is it a negative or positive development?","In the contemparory era, a number of countries, politicians earn less income than celebraties. In this essay, I will discuss the reasons why this is happening and tell if it is a positive or a negative enlargement.

There are several reasons for this. The main one is that society give more respect to celebrities than politicians. Moreover, they are the entertainer of our socity. Therefore, people like to listen and watch them more than politicians for example, Kapli sharma show and narender modi lecture, people will prefer to watch Kapil Sharma shown rather than narendra modi lecture because they will enjoy watching him.

In addition to this, I feel that it is a negative enlargement because politicians are the developer of our nation and our next generations future is in their hands. They will construct education centers. Therefore, government should pay more salary to politicians than celebs.

By the way of conclusion, I would say that allthought the celebrities entertain the society. However, politicians help to construct the future of our childer. All in all, I believe that it is a negative evolution. ",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7
Rich countries are getting richer and poor countries are getting poorer. What is the cause of this? How this problem can be solved?,"The gap between wealthy countries and underprivileged countries is increasing drastically. Whereas rich countries becoming richer and poor countries becoming poorer. There are number of causative factors behind this trend and these can solved with proper solution which will be discussed in the subsequent paragraphs.

To begin with, wealthy countries are getting richer and financially down countries are getting poorer day by day. Primarily, the one main cause of this difference is technology advancement. To explicate, richer countries uses advance technologies to develop their nations and attract tourism. To see advanced technologies people not only started visiting their nation, but also helps to increase their economy by spending money on tourism. On the other side, in poorer countries it can not be seen. Moreover, wealthy countries spending it’s own money on different sectors to produce more money, they do not need any financial assistant from other countries and are independent in economy growth. Hence, they do not need to pay taxes to other nations. While in the financially down countries, for the development of their nations, they need to get loans from richer countries which makes them in debts. As a result, it increase high taxes on all commodities which brings burden on government and local people. Thus, poorer getting more poorer. For instance, as per a report of World Bank, countries who takes financial help from wealthy countries are getting financially down by 20% every year.

Furthermore, the financial gap can be alleviate if financially wealthy countries support poorer countries. Predominately, wealthy countries can help poorer countries financially as well as help them to use advance technologies. To clarify, financially stable countries can give some amount of money without taking it back and give some technologies which helps them to produce more money. It not only helps poorer nations to come out of financial problem, but also helps to start developing their own economy. Thus, Poorer nations can also become wealthy nations. To exemplify, As per a research of Harvard University, if wealthy countries give 10% of their money to poor nations, they will get rid of financial problems.

To encapsulate, Although there are many reasons behind the financial gap between poorer and richer countries, a proper steps can alleviate this gap issue. If all wealthy countries start helping poor nations financially, underprivileged countries soon will come out from financial crisis",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7
Some people say that feeling of compitition should be encourage in children other say they should be taught te become corporative. what is your opinion?,"A number of people ponder that contest should be inspired in juvenile while others think that its not make children life realistic. However, competition disclose child dormant knowledge and they become more associative. This essay will discuss the major benefits of competition outweigh the drawback.

First of all, child are like to imitate all things and cope is also enhance merits or they can spontaneously amplify thinking capabilities. Alongside, cope is seduce them for make good result though innovative new things. Meanwhile, these days, competition is increasing with social circumstances, without challenge leading life is very hard. For an example, a study showed that, this nation is very ahead who is compete with another race beside discover new arms such as, rocket, ballistic missile so more. So I think it is a good effect in child life to do race with their classmate thus they will be capable to accruing more acknowledges but obviously they should accept positive competence side If anyone doesn't suffer from them. Secondly, competition is not a good impact on child life most of the time they copy with any white elephant friends lifestyle. When child can not spend their life, it is drop them different types of crimes like snatching, robbery, mayhem, narcotics business etc. In fact, this effect can not helps to enrich knowledge even though it does not make anyone practical. For an instance, job sector always explore experienced candidate without skill they do not allow on the field. Consequently, competition does not make anyone practical or provide work experienced it distract people from right way. To conclude, sometimes cope rise knowledge and most of the cases it is perturb child from their own way. So my opinion it is better to do right work that doesn't create any hazards in social life and make you practical.",Yes,No,Yes,No,6

First of all, social media is curry ample convenient in people life, it makes faster and easier communication. Though social media allows world-wide friendship thus users are able to learn about their culture, tradition, and languages alongside, it helps to enhance business opportunity. Nowadays, online business is popular all over the world, and people easily access those products from social media it think to boost advertisement. Meanwhile, people can access all kinds of news at the same time. However, multiple studies have found a strong link between heavy social media. For instance, in recent times pupils are participating in zoom class at the same time multiple students are capable of joining the class to pursue their study on the epidemic time. That's why it's more important for all ages and groups to continue their works.

Secondly, social media security is not strong enough, any time information may be stolen by the miscreant. In the cases, people are not safe to browse the internet, or the media include that it can result in the spread of misinformation and the development of bad values such as cyberbully, offensive images. Thereby, it increases the risk for depression, anxiety, loneliness, self-harm even suicidal thoughts. So, I think social media totally depend on users who have accepted it easily they can get benefits or others may spoil their life.

Developed countries have created environmental problems in the world particularly in their contribution to global warming what can be done to reduce the dangers of global warming,"Environmental pollution has enormously increased throughout the world. Developing countries have generated environmental issues specifically in their endowment to global warming. In order to get rid of global warming we should use renewable energy resources. Firstly, there is no doubt that developing countries have increased the risk of global warming to the extent levels. For instance a large number of industries which are running in the developing countries have polluted the atmosphere. While some human activities such as greenhouse effect plays a key role in this regard. Green house gases trap the solar radiations in the atmosphere which results as the increased temperature of the environment across the globe. Secondly, public transport such as cars, buses, motorcycles are also sweltering the environment. Take for example these vehicles release carbon dioxide and methane gases which are adding to the atmosphere. Due to this weather conditions are constantly changing. overall climate climate of the world is becoming more worsen due to the severe conditions such as hot and cold. However due to the severity of hot weather the ice caps are melting which might causes flooding because of the rise in the sea level. Moreover burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas are proved to be a final nail in the coffin in raising the global warmth. Conversely, I think certain crucial measures should be taken by both the government and the masses in order to reduce the global warming. Initially the regime should impose taxes on the industries which mostly cause global warming and warned them to use the alternative sources of fossil fuels. The second step in this regard is that developing countries must rely upon natural resources such as solar energy, tidal energy from seas and oceans as a substitute to those sources which cause pollution in the environment. By obeying and practicing all these measures we might overcome this cause of climate change. To recapitulate, developing countries should strive to exclude the dangers of global warming by using renewable resources, otherwise it would be difficult for us to live on this planet due to extreme weather conditions.

"Due to a shortage of land, vertical buildings appear the norm in futuristic architecture. Do you agree or disagree?","High-rise prosperity in recent years has made a trend of erect-oriented buildings separate all over the world and impact deeply on futuristic design. In my perspective, I totally concur with this statement for some compelling reasons below.

On the one hand, vertical buildings' appearance can hand in with people to cope with many social issues which are existing in our daily life. Firstly, being built with exact acreage of ground, buildings use their height to design and make spaces for many purposes such as for offices, apartments, and to name but a few instead of directly constructing on land. Hence, a great amount of property can be saved to reasonably use for community constructions such as schools, hospitals, parks, and sewer. Secondly, vertical buildings are an ideal way for engineers to design as well as illustrating their inspirations and creative minds. Finally, as a result, a whole city or even a country can have organized arrangements or buildings and ground spaces, which will be stable for a long time.

According to this, human life and the environment are clearly taken advantage of this kind of architecture. When apartment blocks are built, more habitats appear in form of flats and penthouses for citizens to live in. Then, people can live in more and more comfortable and convenient spaces, which can help them to improve their household standard. For the environment, green trees can have larger spaces to be planted and grow up as the consequence of reasonable property's use. Furthermore, some projects of eco-living now are in process that combines trees with flats to develop the air's quality as well as the surroundings. For example, in Vietnam, one project of apartment blocks called Solforest is being built which each flat of the building has large enough space for planting trees with the ambition of covering the city with a green and eco-environment.

In conclusion, plenty of architecture are appeared to serve human life, but vertical designs are stable architecture which not only can help people's living areas but also arrange the infrastructure worldwide. ",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7
A country becomes more interesting and develops more quickly when its population includes a mixture of nationalities. To what extent do you agree or disagree,"If the people of different nationalities will be available in a single country, it will have more ease to make progress. This essay agress that different people population in a country helps a certain country to grow faster. People will be able to share each others ideas and will work together on different products and researches.

I personally reckon that a country having people from outside the country will be really beneficial for the discovery of new things. The first main point is that a country will acquire people from outside a nation it wil be fantastic because when two individuals have different ideas they will automatically exchange each other's thoughts to help each other. For example, my elder brother has problem in speaking English, then a new student from England came to his university and helped him to learn English and my brother taught him Urdu which rally helped the outsider student.

The second main bebefit is the working of different people on various projects and researchers. As we know that if a person with one idea will ry to make a new thing he will always requiresome help with him to finish it so is a person from outside the country will help him he can might invent something new. For example, when Japan opened the Honda company it didn't succeed much but when they did partnershio with Pakistan they became one of the biggest brands in the world.

To sum up, the two benefitd of have different nationalities in a country their will be more sharing if ideas and more working of different items. ",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7

The introduction of plastic money for online transactions have made life easier than ever before. However, few people believe that, there are certain drawbacks of using credit cards for transactions. This essay would discuss the advantages and disadvantages of credit cards followed by a reasonable conclusion

In the recent years, people are burdened by responsibilities of work and home that they do not get enough time for shopping every other week. E-commerce not only has made it convenient for shoppers to purchase products online at the comfort of their homes but also it makes to reduce extra cost for transportation to the shop. Furthermore, credit cards are used for payment of taxes and other legal fees through Government websites which are safe and convenient. Many banks have introduced international credit cards which help the travellers enjoy their visits abroad without worrying physical currency at hand.

Despite the advantages, there are few disadvantages of using credit cards as well.

Many fake call centres have been set up which try to convince people to share their personal details by offering them attractive offers. However, the hackers who have been set up by the governments in various countries to protect the interest of current and prospective users of plastic money.

To conclude, Credit cards have opened a world of new possibilities. It helps people in saving time and makes it convenient to fulfil their responsibilities without having to go out.

Some people believe that computers are more a hindrance than a help in today's world. Others feel that they are such indispensable tools that they would not be able to live or work without them. In what ways are computers a hindrance? What is your opinion?,"In a modern world where opinions are greatly magnified by media, the perception on the use of computers remain divided. It is deemed as a hindrance since it has a tendency to diminish the concept of ""hard work, "" as the boomer generation would say. Some of them claim that the entitlement of millennials is due to their lack of experience in harnessing the value of patience. Another is when computers disrupt the market demand of several industries. For example, magazine publishing companies are now shifting from print to the digital age by launching their websites with the aid of social media influencers. In effect, this will lessen the production of paper as factories will eventually cease their operations.

On the other hand, computers are also recognized as indispensable, especially when the pandemic affected every person across the globe this year. A lot of industries shut down, countries had economic recessions, commercial stores and restaurants had to close, and people had to find ways to keep their jobs running by working remotely. From face-to-face meetings, seminars and conferences, a great proportion of the labor force now resorted to webinars, online rendezvous, and regular email exchanges.

In my opinion, the necessity of this technological system has proved itself time and time again, especially in this period of global transition. Is this inevitable, you may ask? Computers play a huge part in our lives as it transformed the way we communicate, do our work, collaborate, and share information. On a personal note, if I don't have a computer, I might not be able to function without it since it has provided me with every convenience that I can access.

Computers have changed the way people study. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using computers as study aids?,"Currently, modern technologies are developing day by day and computers have a considerable affect the way of people study. This essay below will analyze both pros and cons of this issue.

On the one hand, the utilization of computers in study is advantageous in some certain aspects. Firstly, whenever we go to a shop, school or college, due to the computer, it is primitive for us to find anything that we are looking for. Likewise, if we have to find a book from an enormous library, because of location saved in computer, we can straightforwardly find it without wasting time. More importantly, it has a wide range of opportunities; such as it works without any tiredness, moreover computers perform any labor in a perfect manner with cleanliness.

On the other hand, demerits of using electronic computers on study are varied. Initially, in recent times, we are utilizing from computers continuously, so it impairs our eyes. It is true we can wear special glasses, however, in this case our eyes would become weaker and water starts coming from our eyes. Apart from this, if we connect the internet on a computer, after that radiation of the internet does harm to us. Additionally, if there any young children near to us they may suffer more, furthermore, it is scientifically proven that radiation effects more on birds and they forget the way due to the radiation and also might pass away.

Some people believe that technology has made the lives of workers easier whilst other people disagree. To what extent do you agree or disagree,"In modern life, assorting views are on agenda in terms of the impact of technology on the lives of employees. While a part of society tend to think that technology provides numerous opportunities which are appropriate to ease employees works and enhance lives, there are some people who has opposite opinion. Even though I'm on the side of the first idea, this essay will discuss opposite view too.

Firstly, it is an admitted fact that modern technology has benefits upon workers. Primarily, communication has enhanced the quality of life, as employees these days have easy and relaxing life. For example, in these days, employees can work from their home without any need to go to their office. Thereby this new change in work culture also resulted in enhancement of the quality of work. Therefore, it is a win-win situation for both the employees and employers. Secondly, the new work from home culture has let the employees to spend valuable time with their family members. in this case, the time saved from traveling between office and home would be spent on family members. Furthermore, employees may also lend a help or have spare time to their acquaintances in some activities such as home chores. Hence, the features and innovations that technology ensured us have made our life joyful and amusing.

On the other hand, some people reckon that technology has more drawbacks than benefits. This idea is emerged of the fact that the invention of computer and the Internet are leading employee to more hectic and competitive life. Moreover, humans are social beings and social interaction is a vital and integral part of life. Unfortunately, it is unalterable fact that technology obliges human become estranged from social interaction in other people. However, this view is not acknowledged by majority of people.

To conclude, similarly technology has both advantages and disadvantages to the workers. But, it can be embarked safely that benefits of technology used in industry easily outweigh its drawback.

Many people believe that modern music can have a negative impact on the young. Others believe the effect of modern music is positive. Discuss both these views and give your opinion:,"We are living in an era where music is considered as essential part in order to brighten up one’s moods. While we have various opinions from people of various age groups. Some people believe that modern music has bad impact on our young generation while other people think that modern music has good influence on our future generation.

Considering both statements, I would say that modern music has both pros and cons. Let us first look to the positive side of it. Modern Music has good rhythm which is being created by various musical instruement. In 21st century, most of our younger generation has gone through some level of stress and anxiety. Music plays an important role to boost up one’s mood. It helps you to relax after a really bad day. It has a positive impact on our mood. It helps us to be motivated and happy.

In contrary, our old generation thinks that modern music has a bad impact on our younger generation. There are many reasons of it, but most importantly, they focus towards lyrics. Modern music usually hip hop and rap has most rough/harsh content in lyrics, which can lead our young generation to the path of violence. Videos of modern music are also not good enough to look and share with others, because of the content.

To conclude, I would like to mention that we are living in an era where everything has positive and negative side, it totally depends on us to choose that stuff that can give us maximum advantages and can lead us towards brighter and better future.",No,No,Yes,No,5.5
Many people believe that modern music can have a negative impact on the young. Others believe the effect of modern music is positive. Discuss both these views and give your opinion:,"Music has changed dramatically over the years and new types of music are constantly appearing. Many people feel that current popular styles, such as rap, are just noise and cannot be considered real music, unlike older styles, such as rock and jazz.

Firstly, many people, especially those from older generations, feel that modern types of music can be more harmful than positive. They will say modern music is too simplistic and the song lyrics are potentially dangerous. They feel that rap and hip-hop often deal with dangerous issues such as gang violence or express antisocial views. It is a common opinion that this can be damaging for young people who listen to these songs.

On the other hand, it is important that people are able to listen to the types of music that they prefer; you cannot control people’s tastes or opinions. For young people especially, popular music is an important aspect of identity, sharing an interest in music with their peers brings a sense of stability and belonging. These young people would argue that the lyrics to these songs reflect the modern reality and it is an important way of expressing their experiences.

In conclusion, people will always prefer a certain type of music. People will always be unsure of new things, which they may not understand, and this can be the case with music.

The Growth Of Online Shopping Will Lead To The Closure Of Shops In Cities And Towns,"Over the past decade, the e-commerce space has grown by leaps and bounds albeit regulations and restrictions. Although, for many, the growth in this industry has been encouraging, there are few sections who have raised their concerns that the growth is coming at the expense of local shops. Some of these critics of online shopping have gone one step further to suggest that it is going to hit the final nail in the coffin for local shops in the foreseeable future. While the concerns have a valid basis, to me personally, it is a far-fetched thinking and I believe online and offline shopping are here to stay together.

When it comes to consumer behaviour, the phenomenon of online vs. offline shopping can be compared to the entertainment industry where people have an option to stream content online or to watch it in a physical theatrical setting. Despite the comfort and convenience online streaming offers, people still have equally enjoyed consuming the content offline too. If we can draw parallels between the entertainment industry and online shopping, historical trends clearly suggest that both the channels are here to stay.

Keeping aside the historical trends, if we closely observe both the offline and online channels, we can clearly see that they do complement each other in more ways than one. While online mode brings the convenience to browse through variety, offline has an upper hand in terms of instant delivery and last-mile connectivity. For these reasons, once the dust settles on this debate, I believe, we will find these two channels consolidating and cooperating with each other instead of competing one another. In the times to come, I won’t be surprised if the local shops and e-commerce giants partner in delivering the best experience to the customer in tandem.

To conclude, even though online shopping seems to be cannibalizing the local shopping industry, I clearly see a future where both these channels would realize the synergies and operate in a symbiotic environment, offering the best of both the worlds to their customers. ",No,Yes,Yes,No,6

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? All university students should be required to take history courses no matter what their field of study is. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.,"The training process in university has important effects on the students and future lives. Some people believe that students should be required to take major courses related to their field of study, other people believe that all university students should be required to take history courses no matter their field of study is. I agree with the first idea because of two reasons which I will explore below.

First, taking history courses for all of the university students are just a waste of time. All students when going to university they trying to choose their favorite major and wanting to reach their goals as soon as possible, therefore studying unrelated courses to their major like history courses forces them to spend their time whereas is not necessary for them. For example, one of the most important companies in our city needed some people with special conditions. One of the conditions for that company to be recruited was to graduate within four years. Working for that company is my important goal. But our university required all students to take history courses, because of that I couldn't graduate on time so I lost one of the most important situations in my life.

Second, in this day and age of expensiveness, money plays an important role in students' lives. They have many costs like paying for dorms, books, food, and other important things. They have to spend all the cost of these items themselves without the help of the university. Taking extra courses like history courses waste their money because they cannot use unrelated courses in their future job but they are forced to take them to graduate. For example, they should buy history books which may not be useful after graduation. Furthermore, they can save their money for improving their professional skills that are convenient for their future job.

In conclusion, all university students should not be required to take history courses, not only will that help to save their time but also it can save their money.",No,No,Yes,Yes,6

I am agree that university encourage their students to study range of subjects in addition to their own subjects. In university teachers are very helpful and their nature very friendly.

Some people claim that not enough waste from home is recycled . Then say the only way to increase recycling is for governments to make legal requirements . to what extent you think laws are needed to make people recycle more their waste,"Many people claim that waste products form our home are not recycled in more quantity as compared to recycled products so they think that government should Interfere and pass a strict law against this. so lest us talk briefly in upcoming paragraph about recycling products in our country with relevant example so we can understand what law should be pass on this matter.

Firstly and foremost, lets talk about the different types of garbage bin use in our country and talk about recycling a electronic product. As we know that in our metropolitan cities we use two types of garbage bin like black and green black garbage bin contains solid waste while green garbage bin contain liquid material. as this law is being passed in our country but some people don t follow this for example a person has put a battery into green garbage bin but it should be put into black garbage bin and this lead to major problem like accidents of catching fire.

secondly now let us summarize the things as we previously talk about how people are carless and it cause a bad effect to the environment and now let us talk about a daily activity which is performed by a people and it leads to air pollution as every one know in our country people burn plastic instead of recycling it and that cause low index of quality in the atmosphere sometimes it may cause problem in breathing too.

So in my opinion I would suggest that government should put fines on this type of behavior instead of that they should pass a law who found doing something which cause bad effect to environment should be tell to pick the waste of their locality for that day so that will never repeat it again.

It is often thought that the increase in juvenile crime can be attributed to violence in the media.What do you think is the reason for the growth in the rate of juvenile crime?What solution can you offer to deal with this situation?,"In recent decades, juvenile delinquency has been receiving a great deal of public attention. Although some people believe that brutality in the media is what causes the increase in juvenile crime, some feasible solutions can be considered to address this.

There are a number of reasons why juvenile crime is growing. First, since the media offer many questionable contents, like violent games and movies, teenagers tend to imitate the violent scenes. In fact, young people can become aggressive after watching these programs too much, which leads to solving all the conflicts by violent. Second, adolescents are targeted by narcotic dealers as narcotic trafficking has become rampant. Plenty of evidence suggests that the human brain is susceptible to negative influences of drugs, thus making the young adults have the desire to commit crimes after getting high.

Nevertheless, there is also a variety of solutions to alleviate this issue. First, in order to reduce the harmful effects of exposure to media brutality, parents should control and guide teenagers when they were children, make plans of the weekly family’s viewing and be selective about the content of programs. In fact that, parents could discuss the interpretation of media brutality with the children, become an emphatic listener to their children and support them in sticking to good programs, which helps the youth counter the negative influences of media brutality. Second, law enforcement agency should take steps to tighten narcotic control to ensure little to no medicine supply in the market. For example, imposing stricter punishments for narcotic-related activities, such as life imprisonment, capital punishment would act as a deterrent for narcotic traffickers and buyers, so the narcotic dealers no longer opportunities to get in touch with the young people.

In conclusion, rampage in the media is one of the most contributing factors to juvenile delinquency. By identifying the reasons behind this issue, family and law enforcement agency could minimize the issue to a manageable level.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7
"in many countries, the amount of crime is increasing.what do you think are the main causes of crime. hoe can we deal with those causes?","in last two decades, the crime rate has been increased in most of the countries. In my opinion, crime has many causes to be conducted, but there are some main reasons of crimes which make a person criminal are poverty because of unemployment and laws which are not followed strictly.

Firstly, beyond any cavil the crime is the evidence of some hidden activity such as poverty due to unemployment. Crime is growing as people who are jobless have responsibilities of their families, to provide them food they have the easiest way to fulfilled their family's need is to do crime. For example, a person who is the only member of the family who supports expenses he snatches mobile phones and wallets to get some money to get food for his children. The solution to this problem is to government should offers employment and companies play a role to offers job without any useless conditions.

Secondly, the another factor of crime growth is laziness of our police and bad attitude of our society. Some of our bad citizen never follow rules and do illegal things. For instance, one of the higher-level person do crime and never got punished which instigates him more to do crimes. The solution for this is to government will make a rule that everyone treated as same and strictly if anyone execute crime.

To recapitulate, crime is growing really fast in recent times which is the errors of our society. Unwaged and laws and order are the main factor of crime. Government should take action to improves these issues to minimize the crime. Offering suitable jobs and taking strict actions against guilty people will make our world crime less.",No,No,Yes,Yes,6
Some people today believe that the world’s increase in population is unsustainable and will eventually lead to a global crisis. Other people believe that world population increase is necessary and beneficial as it creates the growth of the world’s economy and society. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.,"The population of the world is ever growing. Some people believe that this increase has created an unsustainable situation and that it will lead to a global crisis. Other people believe that only through an increasing population can the world’s economy and society develop.

This population increase is not constant around the world; population is undergoing significant growth especially in less developed countries, and the continent of Africa is predicted to undergo the highest increase. Many people living in these less developed countries frequently face shortages, such as water, food, heating, cooking fuel and medicines, and people have to live in substandard living conditions by western standards. With more inhabitants, these difficulties will become exacerbated and helping these countries might also create strain on the resources and economies of other countries.

On the other hand, many countries are unable to reach their economic potential due to a lack of skilled work forces. For these countries a growing population can mean a stronger economy and, due to that, a better standard of living. Growing populations can also lead to growing demand for goods, allowing economies to expand. The problem is, however, that countries that are in need of labour forces and increasing demand are already the more developed countries and they meet some of these needs by immigration and exporting goods.

In conclusion, while certain areas of the world are in need of larger work forces to develop their economies, the continuously increasing population could potentially lead to crisis within countries that already struggle to provide for their inhabitants.",No,No,Yes,No,5
The role played by the law enforcement is unparalleled and indispensable in maintaining peace and social stability of a country.,"The role played by the law enforcement is unparalleled and indispensable in maintaining peace and social stability of a country. Consequently, many believe that deploying more police force in streets can reduce crime rates, in the wake of proliferating crimes which are getting uncontrollable for many countries these days. I support this view to a great extent since the fear of police can dissuade people from criminal activities.

To embark on, there are a myriad of reasons why increasing police force can contribute to lowering crime rates. First of all, the majority of unlawful activities are meticulously planned; moreover, these are executed in locations or areas where the reach of law enforcement is weaker. Needless to say, the scarcity of police force is the is the trigger for many criminal activities, as there is less supervision or surveillance to detect and prevent crimes. Therefore, deploying more law enforcement officers in crime-infested areas can cause the crime rates to plummet. Rio De Janeiro, for instance, was infested with criminals and transgressions 10 years ago. However, as part of the government’s initiative to reduce crimes, more police force was deployed there and this miraculously culminated in bringing peace to the city.

On the other hand, increasing police patrolling to circumscribe criminals can be counter intuitive in some cases. The reduction of crime rates is also dependent on the integrity of police force there. In many countries criminal activities are often backed by the local law enforcement officers. Therefore, in such scenarios increasing the number of police officers will not have any significant impact on curtailing crimes.

In conclusion, as police force is indispensable for maintaining law and order, increasing police patrolling/presence can have a remarkable impact on reducing crimes. However, for this measure to be effective, it is also important to safeguard the credibility and integrity of police by eliminating corruption among the force itself.",No,No,Yes,Yes,6
All cars that burn fossil fuels should be banned and electric cars should replace them. Do you agree or disagree?,"Vehicles that releases harmful gases should be prohibited because they are the main causes of air pollution and in order to prevent such pollutants regulations of electric cars should be permitted. I agree with that electric cars should be used because they are cost effective as well as environment friendly.

There are several reason why electric cars are better than the fossils fuels. One of the main reason is electric vehicles are less costlier than the diesel cars. In contrast, electric cars cost less or even equal to conventional cars. These cars doesn't cost for smog tests and no need to buy oils. As a result, it will save your money as well. For Instance, electric cars are often known for its feasibility. Apparently, many of electric vehicles owners need not to be repaired and serviced for longer time.

Another reason is electric cars are better for environment. As these cars does not pollutes the air. On the other hand, the conventional vehicles have the harmful chemicals such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen and sulphur which exhausted in the form of fumes and create massive pollution. Electric cars are environment friendly and these produce harmful gasses along with these cars are less noisy. Therefore it regulates air and noise pollution. There are clean air if more electric cars operated on roads. These results out with less diseases and reduction in number of several health problems.

To conclude, I agree that traditional vehicles should not be operated as these causes more problems and in place of traditional vehicles electric vehicles should be replaced because people can afford to buy these cars and if more number of electric cars on roads the lesser pollution will be produced.

In the modern world there is a movement away from written exams to more practical assessment,"he more advanced the world becomes, the more developed educational methods used.

With respect to this, most schools, universities, and businesses have changed the form of evaluating someone’s level from written tests to reality exams like oral testing.

It’s believed that moving to this new kind of test can enhance a student’s knowledge. From that, they can apply the things which are learnt after the lesson to daily life effectively.

This can be clearly shown by the following example, after learning an article about water worries. Instead of requiring pupils to write an essay about the lack of water in some countries in the world to mark for the final exam. Teachers should demand them to record a video about the way carried out to save water as a proof of understanding the lesson. Another advantage of practical exams is to level student’s speaking skills and their confidence. Specifically, there are several forms of tests such as presentation, face-to-face interviews, which can examine their knowledge and their learning process.

Apart from the positive sides that reality tests bring us, there are some drawbacks of them. In fact, instead of using written tests, the students haven’t got any skills of using language in writing, written expressions or fundamental comprehension of organization in an essay. Besides, preparing for a practical exam is not as easy as a written exam.

In conclusion, transferring from the conventional method to the modern method to judge students has both benefits and disbenefits. ",No,No,Yes,No,5
What are some important qualities of a good supervisor (boss)? Use specific details and examples to explain why these qualities are important.,"A good leader is one who is a good decision maker and place his trust in his/her teammates helping them to grow in their professional career; working with a trustworthy leader can really be a great learning experience.

To start with, to lead a team towards the achievement of a common goal of a specific project really needs a quick and good decision making skills, helping the project move forward when stuck in between, thereby giving a momentum to the team to achieve the required output. At times, for the crucial projects it’s highly required from the supervisor to take the toughest decisions as well for the betterment of the team and project as a whole, like asking someone from the team to leave for violating the ethical rules, which sometimes is a difficult decision to be taken by any boss if he/she is highly sensitive. Thus,

Next, a group of people involved in any project can work with a great passion if they feel that their boss is having trust in them, igniting them to put their head and heart towards the success of the common mission of the team, which will bring fruitful results for everyone after the successful completion of the task in hand. To Illustrate, there could be situations when the teammates can make several mistakes while working on their project, during this time it’s highly important that the leader place trust in his teammates instead of scolding them, which will make the teammates to try and test their own ways of working. Hence, it will develop a trustworthy equation in a boss and teammates making them autonomous.

To conclude, the quality of making right decision a right time will act as a fuel for the project and placing trust in the teammates will make them autonomous and grow. ",No,Yes,Yes,No,5.5
"In the past, most people used to travel to their place of work. With increased use of computers, the internet and smart phones, more and more people are starting to work from home. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this development?","Work from home is getting common day by day in this century. Technology advancement can allow you to control all your office work by using smartphones, laptops and computer. Now in order to manage all your office work, you don’t need to go to the office. This development seems good but it also has some disadvantages.

The advantages of this development are that people can control all their office work from homes; they don’t need to rush to the office in order to do small work. This development helps us to deal with our office work more easily and spend more time with family. This technology helps a lot to the working mother who can give same amount of time to their work and childern.

On the contrary, work from home makes us lazy. Before that we have one routine to follow and that routine keeps us motivated and energetic. Technology advancement makes our lives easy but on the same time it might be difficult for some countries. Under developed countries still have limited resources to continue with this development. In comparison with developed countries, under developed countries still fighting for their legal rights. In under developed countries, not all the people have these electronic devices like laptops, phone etc. Moreover, most of the countries are facing problems of internet as well. Electricity is also main issue in many under-developed countries. If people don’t have electricity, which is the basic source of living, how they can manage to continue work from home.

In conclusion, work from home has both advantages and disadvantages. Work from home seems good, but nothing can replace the experience to go to the office, meet new people and learn everyday. Sitting at home at same place doesn’t give you experience. In order to learn more we need to go out and explore the world. ",No,No,Yes,No,5
Some people think that poverty is the reason behind most crimes. Do you agree or disagree ?,"The latest trends show that more and more poor people are getting trapped in the vicious circle of crime. For this reason, some believe that poverty is the motivation behind this indulgence. I agree with this view. However, I do believe that factors, such as lack of education, drug addictions etc. , are equally important.

First of all, poor people do not possess any assets or source of income. They are unable to afford basic necessities such as food, etc. This scarcity often becomes the motivation to follow the wrong path to earn money. A survey shows that 56% of the population of the world are poor and they hardly meet their ends. As an example, a man who needs to buy medicine for his wife, but he could not because of inadequacy of funds, is very likely to steal them from the medicine shop or might pickpocket some wealth from others.

On the other hand, factors such as lack of education, narcotic addictions, friends influence etc. , are very important. Education helps a person to make the right choices in life and opens the door to multiple job opportunities. An uneducated person cannot differentiate between right and wrong because they cannot assess the damage one wrong decision can do in the long run. So, they might commit offences without thinking about the impact. Another reason is drug addiction. If an addicted person runs out of funds to buy drugs, then to get funds for drugs they start committing crimes. For example, recently a man from Punjab, had kidnapped a 4 year old boy for ransom, to pay for his drugs.

To conclude, poverty is one of the many reasons that leads to crimes. There are multiple other motivations such as lack of education, drug addiction etc. , for committing a crime. ",No,Yes,Yes,Yes,6
"Currently there is a trend towards the use of alternative forms of medicine. However, at best these methods are ineffective, and at worst they may be dangerous. To what extend do you agree with this statement?","Alternative medicine is not new. These are being used way before conventional medicine is invented, and it is still used by many people all over the world. I am unconvinced that it is dangerous and feel that both alternative and conventional medicine can be useful to treat a disease.

There are several reasons why the conventional medicine community finds it hard to believe in the alternative form of medicines. First of all, there has been little scientific research in this field, so there is a lack of evidence to support the claim of their supporters. Furthermore, people often try this kind of treatment by the recommendation of their friends and family, and therefore come to the therapist with a very positive attitude, which may be a part of the reason for the cure. Moreover, these medicines are only useful if someone uses it for the long term. Acute medical problems, such as accidental injuries often required more conventional methods.

On the other hand, despite the lack of scientific proof, there is a lot of evidence to suggest that these therapies are useful. Besides, far from being dangerous, they often have few or no side effects, so the worst outcome would be no changes. Moreover, we should not forget that, when there were no modern medicines available at an early age, peoples used these kinds of alternative treatments to cure themselves, and these prove can be easily found in the histories.

To conclude, I strongly believe that conventional and alternative medicine should coexist. They both have completely different strengths and can be used effectively to cure the disease as well as any particular medical problems. ",No,Yes,Yes,No,6
"In many countries, a small number of people earn extremely high salaries. Some people believe that this is good for the country, but others think that governments should not allow salaries above a certain level. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","Almost every country in the world is having their own economy, which also depends on the income their citizens. Some get a handsome amount while others are unable to grab such fancy jobs, so they think that government should limit the salaries so that everyone will be equal. These things depends on many reasons, from which few will be further discussed in the upcoming paragraphs.

Firstly, the income a person has depends on the degree of educatioion he is having. For instance, a person with higher education will obviously get more amount of money as, he is more knowledgeble, furthermore, the situation is vice versa with others, if someone have not even studied till secondary level, then it is close to impossible that he will be getting the same salary as the CEO of the company is having.

On the other hand, the idea of restricted stipend is totally unfair. According to me, there are several criteria's an employee is marked on, hence, all the things like work pressure, role of the employee and working hours together decides a salary of a person. For example, if a person is working 12 hours, on the position of senior software engineer position then he won't be accepting the restricted salary of 15, 000 Rupees, which a normal employee is also taking. Although, they are working for the same companies, but, their is a huge difference in the work both are allotted to.

to conclude, I would say, it will be a really tough for an educated individual to work on a smaller amount as he has many roles to play in a company. ",Yes,Yes,No,No,6
Internet crime is increasing rapidly as more and more people are using the internet to make financial transactions. What can be done to tackle this problem ?,"The invention of the internet has led to dramatic changes in the way information is shared and distributed. This system has given rise to the problem of cybercrimes as many people are now using the internet for financial transactions. This essay shall explore and discuss some of the measures to combat this problem.

Nowadays, people have started sharing sensitive data on various online platforms for making payments. This lead to cyber security breaches and thousands of dollars are stolen by the hackers in few seconds, therefore; substantial changes should be brought into the system to save our data. One of the solution to this issue is that the web platforms who provide the facility of online money transfer should take the responsibility of securing the data of their customers. To do this, they should install robust anti-hacking software to cease the unauthorised access of the information. Besides this, the payment companies such as PayPal and Google Pay should keep a separate department whose job is to do data surveillance, and inform the higher authorities in case of security lapse.

In addition to this, the government should implement strict rules regarding online robberies. As this is a novel crime, they have not yet set proper criminal and penal codes for these types of crimes. Furthermore, cyber security awareness campaigns should be initiated in the public and make them vigilant regarding online frauds as several incidents have been reported where people gave sensitive personal details such as OTP, and ATM code to the strangers unknowingly and become victims of online thefts.

In conclusion, although the problem of the internet crimes is not insurmountable, I believe that it is the responsibility of both the government and the payment companies to solve this issue. They should work together by considering some of the solutions proposed above to put a stop to these crimes. ",No,No,Yes,No,5
Some people believe that technology has made man more social. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"Experts throughout both the developing and developed world have debated whether the advent of sophisticated modern technology such as mobile phones, laptops and iPad have helped to enhance and improve people’s social lives or whether the opposite has become the case. Personally, I strongly advocate the former view. This essay will discuss both sides using examples from the UK government and Oxford University to demonstrate points and prove arguments.

On the one hand there is ample, powerful, almost daily evidence that such technology can be detrimental especially to the younger generation who are more easily affected by it’s addictive nature and which can result in people feeling more isolated from the society. The central reason behind this is twofold, firstly, the invention of online social media sites and apps, such as Twitter and Facebook have reduced crucial face-to-face interactions dramatically. Through use of these appealing and attractive mediums, people feel in touch and connected yet lack key social skills and the ability to communicate. Secondly, dependence on such devices is built up frighteningly easily which may have a damaging effect on mental health and encourage a sedentary lifestyle. For example, recent scientific research by the UK government demonstrated that 90% of people in their 30s spend over 20 hours per week on Messenger and similar applications to chat with their friends instead of meeting up and spending quality time together or doing sport. As a result, it is conclusively clear that these technology advancements have decreased and diminished our real life interactions.

On the other hand, although there are significant downsides to technological developments, its’ multifold advantages cannot be denied. This is largely because the popularity of technology such as cellphones allows people to connect freely and easily with no geographical barriers. People are able to share any type of news, information, photos and opinions with their loved ones whenever and wherever they want therefore keeping a feeling of proximity and closeness. For example, an extensive study by Oxford University illustrated that people who work, or study abroad and use applications like Facetime and WhatsApp to chat with their families, are less likely to experience loneliness and feel out of the loop than those who do not. Consistent with this line of thinking is that businessmen are also undoubtedly able to benefit from these advances by holding virtual real -time meetings using Skype which may increase the chance of closing business deals without the need to fly.

From the arguments and examples given I firmly believe that overall communication and mans’ sociability has been advanced enormously due to huge the huge technological progress of the past twenty years and despite some potentially serious health implications which governments should not fail to address, it is predicted that its popularity will continue to flourish in the future.",No,No,Yes,Yes,6
Some educationalists think that international exchange visits benefits teenagers at the school. To what extent do advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"Education is considered as passport to success and every country dream that their youth must have better education. Recently, international exchange visits have been introduced into the education system. As like me, many are considering it as a good initiative, but opponents have distinct viewpoint. In an essay I will throw light on both perspectives.

The defender of the stance that going for overseas visits during high school studies will bring numerous merits for the society believe that it is good castling. The significant reason behind this notion is that pupils learn many those skills which they do not learn in their own country. For example, in my home country India, every material of study is provided by the teacher, and student puts less effort to brief study material from a long chapter, and this may build laziness with them and they might not develop highly recommended skills of research. Despite the fact, in many developed nations this progression is not followed, and this makes pupils more active learner.

However, every coin has two sides and the same is true here. The far most important drawback of these visits is that teenage period is the most critical period of one’s life, which required close monitoring of parents. Hence, if students will not be monitored by their parents, they might involve in anti-social activities, and this may destroy their future. Further, these contrary consequences may affect parents negatively. Another pivotal aspect is, orientation of international exchange visits may cause extra burden of poor parents as many times they cannot afford international trips, which can deteriorate their family relation, especially with their offspring’s.

To conclude, it cannot be denied that these international travels while studies have far reaching negative impacts, but these are uncommon. Rather than continuing the disadvantages of this, it will be more beneficial to count the advantages as these can be gained by plentiful pupils. ",No,Yes,Yes,Yes,6.5
The government should allocate more funding to teach science rather than other subjects in order for a country to develop and progress. To what extent do you agree?,"Science plays an important role in the growth and progress of a nation. However, other subjects are also important for the economic development of a country. Therefore, I believe that the government should allot equal funds for the teaching of all subjects.

Science subjects are definitely helpful. They help to solve many problems affecting us and our environment. Government funding will lead to improvement in medical research and the invention of many cures. Health, after all, is wealth. In order for a nation to progress, its people have to be healthy. Research in medical science facilitates this. In addition, scientific research in agriculture can increase the fertility of the land and result in economic growth. Science subjects like technology and engineering also play a crucial role in making our lives happy and comfortable. Obviously, the government funding of science subjects helps the country to develop and progress.

However, this does not mean that only science subjects are important. Other subjects like arts, crafts, literature and humanities also play an important role in the overall progress of a nation. These subjects make people aware of their history and culture. They improve our aesthetic skills and enhance the overall quality of our life. Art subjects provide plenty of job opportunities too. After all, no nation can progress only on the wings of science.

To conclude, government funding should not be limited to science subjects. For the overall development of the country, the government should support the teaching of other subjects as well.",Yes,No,Yes,No,6
Nowadays many people have access to computers and a large number of children enjoy playing video games. What are the advantages and disadvantages of playing video games for children?,"Acitivities are essential part of our live; it keeps us motivated and energetic. Children learn a lot in outdoor and indoor activities. Playing games either inside or outside is really important for children to learn new things on daily basis. Technology advancement has greater impact not only in adult lives but also in children lives.

Children love to play video games either in cell phones, laptops and computers. Playing video games on electronic devices have pros and cons. The disadvantages of playing video games include the children mental health. This growing age of a child is important as he/she is learing new things every single day, it is essential for the parents to keep an eye on their children in order to know what they are doing on regular basis.

This essay will look at the positive aspects these games can have and also the negative effects on children.

Firstly, as education is becoming more demanding for many young people, computer games can provide a way of relaxing and reducing stress. Computer games can take us into different worlds where we can escape from reality. In addition to this, computer games today are very advanced and can help children develop their thinking skills. Instructions need to be understood and games often include complicated problems which need to be solved.

However, there are also many problems with the increasing popularity of computer games. Many children become addicted to them and they play for hours, sometimes through the night. In South Korea, the government has banned children from playing games after midnight as the problem was so great and the effect on education was very negative. Furthermore, some children find it difficult to identify what is real and what is virtual. Some people argue that this has led to a rise in crime inspired by video games. This is not proven, but it is undeniable that games today can be very violent.

To sum up, there are both advantages and disadvantages with computer games and it seems that parents need to exercise caution and monitor their children's activity as some games may be more suitable than others. ",No,Yes,Yes,No,5.5
"In this world, many people are dying from various types of health related problems due to the lacking of appropriate health education and preventive actions."," In this world, many people are dying from various types of health related problems due to the lacking of appropriate health education and preventive actions. That is why a government should expend a huge amount of money from health budget for cure-related education as well as preventive measure. It is agreed that this policy has a great number of benefits and this will be proven by analysing economical point of view of a country and the health aspects of people.

Firstly, many regimes spend an enormous amount of money in order to treat their people who are suffering from different types of serious diseases. This extravagance can be easily diminished when state commences of healthcare educational system by spending money to the health teaching system. As an example, if the administration perceives to their slums that smoking, drinking, and so on is bad things for human body through this educational program, many people will be not attacked by the severe sickness. This could save a large amount of money of the state. As can be clearly seen from this illustration that the idea may bring colossal economic benefit to the government.

Secondly, many governments fight against several types of diseases, especially diabetes and the heart diseases. Before these health problems assault the people, it can be ceased by taking some preventive measure. For example, exercise, sports, entertainment etc. can decrease the chances to become these patients. Making parks, playground, and cinema hall can influence people to do exercise, which can protect the people from these intense sicknesses. This can be achieved by investing the money in preventive measures from health budget.

In conclusions, this idea is indispensable not only to the people but also to the governments. However, the tremendous amenities of this policy fortify my argument. Therefore, a government should spend money for health education and preventive measure from health budget. ",No,Yes,Yes,Yes,6.5
Some people think that ambition is a good quality. Is it an important to be ambitious? Is it positive or negative charactericties?,"Many people hold the belief that one of the good personalities is an aspiration. Although there are some drawbacks to this sentiment, I concede that ambition plays a vital role in daily life. In my frame of thinking, I believe that aspiration is a good characteristic. This is because people would have a strong motivation and patience to achieve their goods. Therefore, an ambitious person usually focuses on their targets and works hard until they reach them. For instance, Elon Musk used to rent a house because he dedicated all his money to establish two companies, namely SpaceX and Tesla and then he became the richest person in the world thanks to his ambition. Furthermore, aspiration also helps people manage themselves avoiding waste time such as surfing the internet, playing video games. Consequently, ambition is the best quality which brings benefits for people in their life. However, this ambition also will have drawbacks side if people are over aspiration. First of all, people would not listen to the opinion of others because aspirate people have a fixed path. Therefore, they are more likely to fail and then they would try again to fit problems under the pressure of family, society. As a result, it creates heavy pressure on people and makes them tired, low self-esteem and even disappointed. Moreover, ambitious people maybe find different ways to achieve their goals which could be an illegal and ethical act. Thus, it impacts their mental and brings bad behaviors such as impolite, dishonest. In conclusion, I strongly believe that aspiration is a good personality which vitally needs to have in life. Nevertheless, people should control and balance it in order not to affect their life. ",No,No,Yes,No,5
Some people say that the Main environmental problem of our time is the loss of particular species of plants and animals. Other day that there are more important environmental situation. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.,"It is argued that at present extinctions of some animals and plant species are the major environmental problem, while others hold that other environmental problems are more important. Although some plant and animals have always played an essential role in human lives, air pollution has detrimental effects in people's lives. I agree with the former view.

Plants and animals have played a viral role in people lives. It provides ample essential things that are not merely important for humans lives but also for animals and plants. However, with the help of some advanced technologies now it is possible to reproduces some species of plants and animals that went into extinction. Cloning and planting are new methods that reduce extinction some species. For this reason I believe that lost of some species of animals and plants are no more a main environmental problem. For instance, increase the breed method can increased the number of animals and plants.

Furthermore, a major environmental problem is air pollution. Since many people are depending on advanced technologies and often using vehicles. it reduces the consumption of time. As a result, air pollution has become a hazard problem for the environment. Vehicles produce toxic and hazard emissions that directly affects to the environment. For instance, Delhi, is the capital of India, produce toxic emissions due to overpopulation. Consequently, governments have increased the prices of vehicles so people can not afford it.

Overall, I believe that extinction of some plants and animals are not no more a main environmental problem, although it is essential for people' Lives. Air pollution has drastically increased due to the increase number of vehicles.

I conclude, plants and animals can be reproduce by some advanced technologies, but air pollution is the main environmental problem due to variable usage of transport system.

It is the propaganda of the Government that plays a major role to look after this issue. The competitiveness among the people, to live a luxurious life lead them to disturb the natural habitat. For instance, if there is no law, then the business people would have destroyed the entire plants for the manufacturing of paper, furniture, etc. It is the policy of the Government that had helped to save the planet Earth from such activities.

In addition, the crime number would increase drastically as a result of people’s independency on decision making during the venture of life. The rage of balancing the pace with others in the society makes the individual to fail the sense of analysing their own actions. Imprisonment and punishment are the consequences of the wrong doings, for example, the people committing murder out of anger are brought under the jurisdiction to prevail the justice for the lost life. This indicates the importance of rules and order, or else, anyone can take one’s life just to express their emotional distress like anger.

First and foremost, having fewer businesses supports others to get money. These days, there are a number of companies selling similar products. Therefore, the reduction of the smallest organisations automatically means more chances for different brands. For instance, apple is known for designing mobile phones. However, on the scene are additional industries creating the same items which means people need to choose from a range of options. Consequently, the decrease of possibilities lead to the higher profit in favour of large business.

On the other hand, great variacy of organisations is vital for the society. It is a fact that every human is different, due to this, needs of a person can vary a lot. Furthermore, in some situations, majority can not find the proper product created in the start up, because it does not exist anymore. For example, my mother wanted to buy a special shirt but she could find the shop. Afterwards, she read that company for replaced by commersianlized business. Lastly, she was angry and really upset.

In conclusion, to do not have the necessity to fight with a result of earning more money is an extreme plus. Athough, the freedome of choice is a part of life that should not be replaced. Accordingly, I am certain that disadvantages have more crucial values than benefits.

Some people believe that teaching children at home is best for a child’s development while others think that it is important for children to go to school. Discuss the advantages of both methods and give your own opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience,"There is no doubt that a child’s development is of utmost concern for parents. Although some people that homeschooling is better for the children, others argue that the child should physically go to school. In this essay, I will discuss both sides of the topic and explain my reason to support the latter view.

One of the biggest advantages of teaching children at home is that the child stays under the supervision of his parents. They have an advantage to educate the child on subjects and topics which they might feel would be beneficial for him to excel in future. To illustrate, a father might focus more on developing the skill of dealing with numbers in his child with a mind-set that his son might have a successful career being a financial analyst or broker. In addition, the parents will have a benefit to inculcate the ethical values in the child.

On the contrary, I would argue that children should go to school as it polishes the different aspects of his personality. When they go to school, along with getting educated on different subjects, they also get an opportunity to interact and socialize with other children. For instance, the child might study various subjects during the class hours but during the lunch break and physical training session, the kid gets to enjoy and explore with other children and make friends with them. If they were being schooled at home then they would have missed on getting educated on multiple subjects and learning the ability to network, which play an integral role in the personality development.

To sum up, while there are advantages of teaching children at home, but we must take into consideration the additional benefits of personality grooming that a school offers. Therefore, I would not want to homeschool my children. ",No,Yes,Yes,Yes,6
"The number of people being sent to prison is increasing year by year. While some people believe prison is the best way to tackle crime, others suggest that community service is more successful. Discuss both views.","Increased number of people are being prisoned every year. Some would argue that community service shows more success, while other argue that only prison can help to help to alleviate crime. Even though working for the community can change criminal's mind, victim will not feel safe knowing that criminal is out there.

On the other hand, community service provides a great platform for a criminal to help others and gives an opportunity to be a better person again. Thus, their perspective towards society will change and consequently they will be less like to commit any crime again. For an instant, according to a research from Queen University suggest that 60% of criminals who provided community services are now living a normal life resulting in less number of crimes.

On the other hand, although community service may benefit criminal, it will be hard for victim to fill safe. There are chances that crime will be repeated again if the criminal is not imprisoned. Victim can live in a constant fear. For example, Leena will not be able to go out for anything as she was kidnapped during her childhood if she will have to see kidnappers in the community.

In conclusion, Imprisoning the criminal is the only best way to reduce crime and community service is not an option as it is important for victim to feel secure. ",No,No,Yes,Yes,6
"Art is considered an essential part of all cultures throughout the world. However, these days fewer and fewer people appreciate art and turn their focus to science,technology and business?","Art play an imperative role in today's era. Nowadays, every individual showing their interest in science, technology and business rather than in art. I think this trend is going toward a negative development and this essay will discuss the reasons of negative development alongwith solutions in subsequent paragraphs. To commence with, there are several demerits of decreasing interest in art. First and foremost, history of particular nation could be washed out, where number of people are diverting toward business and science because artists alway display most probably history related paintings in museums. Therefore, if these museum replace with business, then history will devastated. Secondly, people could not able to express their talent in society. With the help of art, people alway acquire opportunity to show their skills, by which they can get name and fame. To exemplify, recent survey of Gulph University, Canada showed that the artists who are well known in society alway depicts their interest in art rather than business and technology, which is the reason of their success. Furthermore, there are plethora of ways to persuade people toward art. Chiefly, government of every nation should held competitions of art, in which they provide rewards to artist who will win these competitions. These prizes will help to provide more ficus of people in art. In addition to it, government should also aware people regarding the vital role of art in society. Thus, this way people would be more encourged in art. To recapitulate, it can be concluded that by decreasing interest of art, there will be a deleterious effect on nations. Therefore, goverment should do some efforts to make existed of art in society.

"Life nowadays is generally much more stressful than in the past. Give some reasons why people suffer more from stress nowadays, and say what they can do to reduce it.","There is considerable growth in stress level these days, as compared to the past, but we can do something to reduce level of stress. This essay will discuss some of the problematic factors behind this problem, and the measures that people can take to overcome this.

Firstly, the reason for stress is that we are living in a fast-paced world. This means that there is an ongoing race, and everyone is busy to compete with each other. As a result, no one has time even for their own, and also, they do not find time to get themselves relax. Secondly, people are busy in technical gadgets. In other words, people are in contact with the distant ones, and they ignore those who are sitting behind them. For example, people make many friends on social media; they are busy in chatting with them; thus, those who are closer to them and want to share some stuff but they don’t because no one is their for them to listen.

There are two effective solutions to tackling this issue. One way to tackle this is to make a daily schedule for them. In addition, there should be some outer-entertainment, in that time table. By doing this, they can find time for their own. Another method of dealing with this is that, whole family should gather daily for an hour, they should share their full they activities, and social media should be on side for that time. This solution would hopefully prevent them from going into stress.

In conclusion, daily plan and less use of social friends are effective in dealing with the stress. If people implement these solutions, they can enjoy stress free life. ",No,No,Yes,Yes,6
Some people think that educated people are more valuable than people who have learned skills through experience. Do you think that educated people are the most valuable for society? What kinds of skills can people learn through experience that can benefit society?,"It is a common belief that the most worthy of ones in our society is to study a lot instead of the ones who developed its skills by experiencing. I think that we should not underestimate the value of someone who learned its skills through practices. Further, communication technique with years of practicing could benefit our society as a whole.

I believe that people learned skills through practices have more resilience to face many difficult challenges in contrast to those people who merely study the theories in class. As we live in a world where is full of risks and potential threats in different sectors. Educated people had spent years in a protected environment with very little chances to explore the real world. Which blinds them from seeing the side of cruel and dreadful our rapidly changing society. However, people who trained its skills via experiences are the ones entered into workforce early and that resulting them in realizing what to expect and learn from its failures.

In addition, having communication skills with intense practices are definitely beneficial to our society. Because it enables people to learn from one another. Even it is for the educated people who have not ever been working in their lifetimes. As they could use this technique to avoid making many mistakes. Which eventually aids to improve our society economically and culturally.

To recapitulate, some believe that learning skills via experiences rather than in education are less value in our society as a person. However, toughness could be developed in ones because of it and, this attribute character arguably has a significant contribution to our society. Moreover, the master of communication skills in ones would enhance our society to move forward. ",No,No,Yes,No,5.5
"Some people say that in our modern age, it is unnecessary to teach children about the skills of handwriting. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is irrefutable that due to the advancement in technology, electronic gadgets such as computers, laptops, mobile phones have become part and parcel on individual's life. So, quite a few people hold their point of view that in this contemporary era, teaching to pupils about handwriting is completely non-essential. After going delve deeper, I am strongly disagreed with this notion.

To embark on, the first and foremost significant reason behind this unfavourable practice is that although most of the youngsters have adapted technological equipment to express their thoughts as well as feeling, but hand writing is still prominent for children who take admission in schools as they have to finish their school work by writing it on notebooks. Moreover, they give their examinations in the written form instead of typing on computers. Hence, handwriting is required to fulfil their academics requirements.

Moving towards another reason that can not be negligible. Having beautiful handwriting enables children to boost their confidence level as they love their writing which leads to more focus on studies and it improves their academic result. A painstaking research has had been undertaken which disclosed that two-third children who have good handwriting skills become successful person in future. Last but not least, it also enhances their mortar skills such as creativity, imagination because when they start writing, they can think deeply and can express themselves in an effective way.

In conclusion, despite the influence of modern technology, handwriting has still its own importance in one's life. So, it should have essential part of student's studies. ",No,No,Yes,No,5
"Despite health warnings, a large number of people continue to smoke all over the world. Why should we be concerned about this? What solutions would you suggest?","In our modern world today controlling a habit of smoking is one of the controversial concern in every part of the world. Although a plethora of diseases connected to this inevitable habit, still an enormous number of individual could not halt the urge of smoking. This essay will discuss why we should give attention on this issue and provide some solutions.

Generally every person smokers or non-smokers should be aware that the smokes coming from the cigarette contribute a harmful effect on ones body. To elaborate this is for example, a family which is the father is smoker even though he is smoking outside the house away from his wife and children. The fact that he smokes outside but still the smokes are around somewhere in their house and also the smells of the cigarette can attached to his skin and even to his clothes. This smells can also inhaled by his family. A continuous habit like this will eventually damage their health and lead to different kinds of diseases like asthma, pneumonia or ever worst a lung cancer.

There are various solutions to this damaging problem. The role of the government as well as each citizens working together can overcome such habit. For example, the government can implement a banning of using cigarette in public places like, market, streets, and parks to name some. In addition to this, if they caught smoking in those restricted areas they will charge a fine. Another thing is that the government can increase a tax to all tobacco and cigarettes. If this happen a person for example earning an average income would find it hard to purchase. Moreover, this will cause a lesser number of cigarette used everyday. With these few ideas that I suggested if implemented by the government and follow by the smokers can have a positive impact on their lives.

In conclusion, although the government impost a law and restrictions still it is every persons responsibilities to look after their health as well as their family.",No,Yes,Yes,Yes,6
A second language is regarded as essential to success in the modern world.It should be compulsory for all children to study a second language as soon as they start school.,"In our modern days in order to give yourself more options to develop is to study languages. This can facilitate the achievement of your further plans and life goals. Many people believe that children should begin to study second language with the beggining of their education.

I fully agree that kids should be obligated to study another language grom an early age. This will surely give them advantage in the later years. A little problem is that they start whit it in a time that they cannot yet understand the importance of what and why they are doing it. Because of that the second language can be sometimes neglected by them when they get a little bit older. I have many friends that after we graduated high school had regreted that they did not payed enough attention in class and did not study as hard as they should. I think high school is the time when we need to understand what we desire to do with our lives in the future. And if we disregard education, we will surely suffer later on. So to avoid to get in situation like this and help young people, as soons as they walk in school it should be explained the importance and the advantages of specifically learn a second lannguage.

In a different situation, when a person wants to study abroad or work abroad, it would not be possible without knowing the language they speak. It is going to be required to speak it freely. To expand the area and the possibilities of your own evolving, knowing different languages and being able to communicate with people abroad is a must. I personaly want to go study abroad and because of that I must speak English freely without having trouble to comunicate or understand other people. Another requirement is to have a certificate from the British counsil that I have covered all the demands.

To conclude, knowing two or even more languages is always going to help you in life and give you many more possibilities to progress in life. ",No,No,Yes,No,5
"The graph examines data about the revenue generated, in billion pounds, by Southland's three primary export sectors (international tourism, dairy products and meat products) in the three years 2000, 2021 and 2025.","The world as a whole adapting to a virtual environment nowadays where the term internet plays a crucial role, thereby providing abundance of information and upgrading communication. Despite the benefits, there are some people who say that these social platforms should be in control. However, others actually rely on it in all cases. This essay will discuss both of these perspectives in positive and negative attributes of each.

While there are benefits in the usage of internet throughout the world, there are also drawbacks. The main reason why this usage is important and should not be limited is because, the internet provides immense knowledgeable factors and updates where one can have easy access towards self-study. For instance, with the help of internet and using it as a tool I prepared for my software certification. As a result, with no doubt I cleared with good gradings. Moreover, pertaining to this quarantine situation, many people are separated from their houses, but with the aid of internet everyone can communicate easily who are situated in some other place that is far. However, on the other side, they might make people to get addicted in a faster rate. Currently the younger generation is getting attracted towards net-based games which ultimately result in addiction. These are the absolute plus and minus aspects of internet

Controversely, with reference to the above fact on addiction some believe that the flow should be limited. Moreover, parents are really vary about their children regarding this game addictions and wanted them to use these facilities in a controlled manner. But, nowadays owing to the pandemic situation, all the teaching methods are following a virtual manner which requires adequate internet connection for one to invlove in the class and prepare for online examinations. In addition to this, if there is a controlling criteria in the usage of internet then it would lack in self-learning part which is extremely important in today's world.

To sum up, everyone all around the world use internet to a greater extent to gain a lot of information in order to have a good exposure on studies by self-learning and as a platform to communicate virtually in this current world. ",No,No,Yes,Yes,6
Farming is the backbone of every country but nowadays many youngsters hesitate to enter in this profession. Why is this the case and what can be done to avoid it?,"Farming is a primeval profession that can change the fate of a country. Numerous businesses have direct and indirect interaction with the agriculture sector. Unfortunately, there are many reasons as to why the youth are lacking interest in adopting the agricultural sector, over which I would throw light with supportive references and solutions to curb this problem.

Firstly, the increasing mindset of people to attain better standards of living is making the youngsters craving to get white color jobs with fat income. Every parent wishes that their children achieve a better quality of life by getting better education and finally a comfortable and satisfied employment. This scenario that’s been inculcated into the youth since their childhood makes them think that there is no comfortable life if they don’t study well. It can be witnessed that 90 % of youngsters in India either want to become an engineer or a doctor and if they don’t secure a place in any of these sectors they presume a poor career prospects. Such psychology needs to be eradicated from the mindset of the youngsters and their elders to explore potential career path.

Secondly, last two decades have witnessed as to how industrial and communication revolution spread their wings into all walks of life. Due to the shortage of time, 70 % population are dependent on ready to eat foods, which indirectly encouraging the agriculture sector and at the same time gaining commercial value to the sector. Government organizations must make programs and propose financial aid to encourage youth in taking up farming as their prime work. Educational institutions play a pivotal role in marketing the importance of agriculture in adolescents, which would not only develop strong economy but also potential youth that would change the phase of the country in global village.

In conclusion, youth of the nation must realize if no one opt the agriculture sector there will come a day where we would not have sufficient food derivatives. It becomes the elder’s responsibility to educate their children the importance of farming and make them learn the science, so as they can support themselves and support from organizations will also help in educating the common man about the importance of farming that would support the economy and change the fate of the country.

"With the advancement of faster transportation system, especially air travel, people nowadays go to other countries for personal, business, recreational, official, health and educational purposes.","With the advancement of faster transportation system, especially air travel, people nowadays go to other countries for personal, business, recreational, official, health and educational purposes. The air travel is cheaper than the past and worldwide communication system, particularly Internet, has opened the doors of international tourism. An overwhelming number of tourists travel to different countries and this number is increasing every year. No doubt the international tourism is a very large industry and has many negative aspects. However I believe that the advantages it offers well exceed the demerits it has.

First, due to the global trade many companies have multiple offices in different geographical locations. Businessmen and office executives can these days visit other branch offices for their meeting, training and business needs. This opens the possibility of running a global business or working in a multinational company which has a huge positive impact on a country’s economy. International travel has made it possible for some medium entrepreneurs and business owners to expand their business opportunity beyond the border. For instance, a huge number of medium size importers nowadays from my country visit China and some European countries to personally explore the business opportunity there. They even get some business ideas by visiting these countries and can make arrangement to export locally made goods. This, in my opinion, is a great advantage that the international travel offers.

Second, people can go to a country where medical treatment is better than his own country. For instance, a large number of people visit developed countries each year for better treatment and this is a positive development that ensures quality healthcare for many people. Similarly people travel to other countries to enjoy their holidays and this is a great opportunity for learning about diverse cultural aspects. With the increasing international tourism industry people have better understanding of foreign cultures and it help reducing the gap among nations. This is an important aspect for maintaining world peace as more people travel and experience other cultures, more their misunderstanding about others reduces.

Finally, tourism industry has created a huge job opportunity and countries like Maldives, the Bahamas, Thailand, Indonesia, Anguilla, Aruba and Macau depends on this industry.

On the other hand, international tourism has some negative aspects that cannot be overlooked. Damage in bio-diversity, increasing environment damage, more garbage production, influence of foreign culture and threats of terrorism are some aspects that the booming international tourism industry creates. The amount of danger the air-fuel causes is an alarming issue for many environmentalists.

In conclusion, the massive international tourism industry and ever increasing international travels have some environmental, cultural and terrorism related issues. However the opportunity and potentiality it has already created far outweigh the disadvantages of it. I believe that in this era of globalization international travel is a timely demand that will increase with time. ",No,No,Yes,Yes,6

"Some people are born with certain talents, for instance, sports or music, and others are not. However, it is sometimes claimed that any child can be taught to become a good sports person or musician. Discuss both views, give your opinion.","People have various views concerning what truly makes a person a good performer or a talented individual. Some people argue that talent is an innate gift, while others, including myself, have a different opinion, each achievement can accomplish with the right teaching, proper direction and hardworking.

On the one hand, some children are born with special gifted, such as sports and musical talent who can achieve professional degrees in these fields with relatively less effort than others. Undoubtedly, there have been numerous people in the globe who have amazed the world with their innate abilities, such as or Beethoven in music, Einstein in physics, and Pelé in football. Thanks to this gift, these people become aware of their interests quickly and more comfortable and can obtain significant success less difficulty. Nevertheless, because someone is born with a certain talent, it does not mean that they will achieve success in that field.

On the other hand, practice makes a man perfect. People have this opinion because under appropriate circumstances and good preparations, people can acquire skills that could enable them to excel in a profession or talent, such as music or sport. One good illustration is Cristiano Ronaldo, a football player who has become one of the best athletes of the last few years with his hard work. Moreover, due to technology and behavioural analysis, the criteria and factors that lead to success can be obtained.

To conclude, success can be gained by continuous practice. This, however, does not mean that inborn skills are irrelevant, but I strongly believe that perseverance and proper training are more important than innate talent because people with inherent talent also need persistence. ",No,Yes,Yes,No,6
Prison is the best punishment for criminals. Do you agree or disagree with statement. Write a 250 words with relevant example.,"These days, crime has become a fashion in numerous parts of the world that is evidenced by regular television news. But what is the most effective method to dealing with crime? Some people believe that prison is powerful to punish the victim though others claim the better ways to teach a lesson. I opine that prison is the best way to punishment but other methods can also improve the behavior of criminals. In this essay, I will support my opinion with relevant examples.

Firstly, prison shows the value of freedom to the culprit. What I mean by this, common people are free to do anything what and when they want unlike criminals, who are bound in certain places with hard rules. For example, The documentary of criminals has been upload on the internet, it represented the life of Jail and the hardels they faced on regular basis.

Another reason why I support prison punishment is the safety of victims who survive from offender action. If criminals will not get prison punishment then lawbreakers may try to attack survivors and it may danger to their life. Take thief as an example. While stealing money from banks, houses, or shops, a plethora of cases reveals the murders which is done accidentally.

On the contrary, a prominent reason why I disagree with prison’s punishment because a large number of prisoners who are not an actual danger to society, But they are kept in lock-up with those who did dangerous crime such as smuggling. The number of prisoners may be influenced by the bad society of smugglers which leads to becoming a virus for society rather than an improvement in behavior.

In conclusion, punishing the criminals in prison is one of the best ways to teach lessons because they may release the value of freedom and survivors feel safe in society. But dealing the crimes with one eye will be made some unfair punishment. ",No,No,Yes,Yes,6

However, some people believe that modern music are creating energy while listening.

Firstly, lets talk about the negative impact, modern music are mostly too harsh and the lyrics are used very bad manner. By hearing modern music frequently, it will slowly make our mind completely negative. this is my personnel opinion and this thought will vary person to person.

on the other hand, current generation people think that, its depend upon the personnel choice and the modern music is reflecting our current life style, so we cannot stop or force someone to choose their taste.

Around the world more and more people today are living in urban areas. Why is this? What problems does this cause?,"These days, the number of individuals who reside in industrial areas have been increased. The causes of this trend are various, but there are mainly two causes. Both of them will be discussed in the following lines. Furthermore, I will highlight some of adverse effects of this trend.

The main reason why many people prefer to live in city is looking for jobs; in other words, the chance to get a job with good pay in big city is higher than getting the same in a country side. For example, 80 % of the companies are loacted in Cairo city which has forced many egyptian to move from their small towns to the Egypt's capital. This is why the current president, Mohammed, has encouraged business to relocate their office and build factories in rural ares by giving them incentives

Another significant reason is the quailty of facilities and services which are provided by the governement in small towns. The infrastructure, health and educational services given by a concerned authority are not the same ones given in big cities. Thus, some people travel for hours to get better medical treatment since they can not find it where they live.

The increase number of people in urban areas has led to some serious issues. Firstly, it has increased the crimes rate, and this is becuase of the poor living condition. Secondly, it also has increased the pollution precentage. Finally, it put a huge pressure on governements to deal with the overcrowding issues in cities.

In conclucion, having presented the main causes of the sharp rise of city residents. It can be said that it is important issue which has to be not neglected and addressed carefully to mitigate its current consequences and avoid new ones in the future. ",No,No,Yes,Yes,6
In a number of countries some people think it is necessary to spend large sums of money on constructing new railway lines for very fast trains between cities. Discuss both view and give your opinion.,"Many argue that huge financial suppotts should be dedicated to rail transport systems between cities in order to expand the high speed railway routes, while others believe that previously built public transport is the superior choice for spending money. In my view, spending money on the existing public transport could be a squander in many aspects, including low capacities of these systems and environmental consequences they might carry on.

Trains and railway transport systems are in centre of focus nowadays, owing to their uncountable capacities and astonishing benefits in comparison to other means of transportation. A plethora of advantages are specific to fast trains. High speed and percise time table of daprture and arrival for instance, are two key merits of this transport system. Furthermore, Today's magnetic leviated high technology trains are relied on electricity and as a result, are immensely nature-friendly.

In terms of efficiency, despite up to date infrastructure the public transport is equipped with, these systems are reaching to their maximum potential. In other words, there are certain limitations over transportation services' quality in cities and towns which deprive them from getting more beneficiary. However, accurate budgets must be considered in order to maintain public transports systems, but not more than certain services in order to keep it working. In contrast, a supremely brilliant future is anticipated for rail transport.

To sum up, it is expected for the next decade that majority of people opt rail way transport among present choices, due to the fact that extremely fast trains are relaible and benevolent for environment as well.

"You should spend about 40 minutes on this task. Write about the following topic. Are famous people treated unfairly by the media? Should they be given more privacy, or is the price of their fame an invasion into their private life? Discuss both these views and give your own opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. You should write at least 254 words.","The media follows famous people and interfere in their private life. It is questioned by many that media doesn't treat famous people fairly and invade their private life. This essay will discuss this in details and why they should have a more private personal life.

Media usually follows popular public to get content for their reports and to gain more TRP. In order to get the content, they do not think even once about the person and keeps on reporting the good/bad stuff without any proof. For example, in the recent news there was an article about a famous actor who did suicide. Media followed the case so badly and the girlfriend of the actor was harassed so badly by the media that her career is destroyed even when there is no exact proof of what actually happened with the actor. Furthermore, they only focus on gaining TRP by any means, like copying the content from the famous people's social media account. For example, media reporting anything that a famous bollywood actress posts on her social media account. Thus, media doesn't care about the famous people.

Addition to that, media has not even left personal life any more private and keep on publishing private stuff to the public. It is not a healthy practice to invade someone's private life and could cause major harm. The harm could be as dangerous as a life threat. We all remember princess Diana, she died in car accident while running away from media to protect her privacy. This is a lesson that reporters should learn to leave the popular personalities personal life private.

In conclusion, it is correct to say that the famous people are not being treated correctly by the reporters, just to gain popularity for their channel and could cause extreme bad to one's life. And I agree that, they should be given enough privacy in a way that it should not effects a person's well-being. ",No,No,Yes,Yes,6

international tourism creat great benefits on different levels. first and foremost, it provides individuals opportunities to see others culture first hand. according to my observation, visiting to another country is a comprehensive experience. which is much more enjoyable than starting at another culture on a computer screen. additionally, overseas tourism has produced plenty of employment opportunities in host country. secondly, knowledge that gain between cross culture is also promote cultural diversity. in this way, individual can expand their outlook and become worldliar.",No,No,Yes,No,5
Some people say that music is a good way of bringing people of different cultures and ages together. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"It is said that music has the power to unite and connect people, regardless of their cultural backgrounds or ages. I completely agree with this view, and my reasons are stated below.

Music is an effective way of communicating among people with different cultures, languages, races, and can bring them together. For about forty years, live concerts have been held with singers from different countries to help people were affected by natural disasters and war. Through humanitarian concerts, diverse cultures and age groups come together. As a result, people enjoy being together, and due to the information contained in these concerts, they become aware of the people who need help in the world. Surely, music can be a language of empathy and unity among people around the world.

Also, music is a form of art, which everyone appreciates. Undoubtedly, one of its values is that it can bridge the gaps between generations and ages. When songs and melodies regarding peace, sympathy, and love are released, are not restricted to a specific age. In fact, they can affect varied age groups equally because they represent emotions and the inner nature of humankind. Besides, there are numerous teenagers and young people who adore listening to traditional music with their parents and even grandparents, and in the opposite, elderly individuals who choose to listen to new styles of music such as hip-hop. I would claim that no other form of entertainment can bring generations together in this way.

In conclusion, music is a significant part of peoples' lives, and it can also act as a powerful means of uniting people of different cultures and ages. ",Yes,No,Yes,No,6
"Some people are born with certain talents, for instance, sports or music, and others are not. However, it is sometimes claimed that any child can be taught to become a good sports person or musician. Discuss both views, give your opinion.","People have various views concerning what truly makes a person a good performer or a talented individual. Some people argue that talent is an innate gift, while others, including myself, have a different opinion, each achievement can accomplish with the right teaching, proper direction and hardworking.

On the one hand, some children are born with special gifted, such as sports and musical talent who can achieve professional degrees in these fields with relatively less effort than others. Undoubtedly, there have been numerous people in the globe who have amazed the world with their innate abilities, such as or Beethoven in music, Einstein in physics, and Pelé in football. Thanks to this gift, these people become aware of their interests quickly and more comfortable and can obtain significant success less difficulty. Nevertheless, because someone is born with a certain talent, it does not mean that they will achieve success in that field.

On the other hand, practice makes a man perfect. People have this opinion because under appropriate circumstances and good preparations, people can acquire skills that could enable them to excel in a profession or talent, such as music or sport. One good illustration is Cristiano Ronaldo, a football player who has become one of the best athletes of the last few years with his hard work. Moreover, due to technology and behavioural analysis, the criteria and factors that lead to success can be obtained.

To conclude, success can be gained by continuous practice. This, however, does not mean that inborn skills are irrelevant, but I strongly believe that perseverance and proper training are more important than innate talent because people with inherent talent also need persistence. ",No,No,Yes,No,6
" Some students take one year off between finishing school and going to university, to travel or to work. Do you think that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?","Some pupils take a year break after finishing their high school studies for travelling or working before they register in a university.

On the one hand, there are some profits for high school graduates who decide to enter the job market or travel for a year before enrolling university.  When young students travel, they can know various people and cultures and because of that, gain valuable experiences and their horizons broaden at an appropriate age.  Consequently, travelling makes students mature, which is effective in their better performance at the university.  For instance, many students enter college with little idea of what they want to study or do after graduation.  Another positive outcome is that while working young people can discover their favorite job, they will choose their field of study more consciously because they are in the job market. They can also handle the money they earn during this year to cover their university fees.

However, the one-year gap between school and university has potential downsides for students. First,  students who work after graduation from school obtain a sense of financial independence, which lead them to prefer staying in the job market to study academically at the university.  Second, a year of travel will cost a large amount of money for young students. According to the ""New York Times"", a three-month trip can cost up to $10, 000.  Moreover,  returning to college after a gap year can feel awkward.  A one-year break causes students to stay away from the subjects and the academic environment and as a result, forget much material, which will challenge them to begin the university and take the entrance exams.

In conclusion, despite some negative aspects, in my opinion the benefits of a gap year are more significant for the reasons mentioned. ",No,No,Yes,Yes,6
Some people enjoy change and look forward to new experiences. Others like their lives to remain the same and do not like any changes. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Some people like change and want to explore new things; others, however, detest it. In my opinion, both approaches have their merits; however, learning to accept change is more beneficial for success.

People who dislike change are the ones who are afraid of the uncertain. They have lived all their lives in a certain way and have become quite comfortable with it. Consequently, they do not see any reason to change it or get out of their comfort zone. Hence, they hesitate to change jobs, learn a new skill or conquer their fears. For example, many people are unhappy in their jobs; yet, they want to stay in that job because they are afraid of quitting. They are anxious that if they quit their job, they will not be able to find a new job. This fear of the unknown prevents them from making any changes to their life. Likewise, many people are struggling in toxic relationships, but they lack the courage to get out of it and change the situation. There are also some people who thrive when they have a routine to follow.

By contrast, there are many people who believe that change is the only constant. They are always eager to explore new things and take on new challenges. This approach towards life is beneficial for people who have a natural ability to turn things to their advantage. For example, during times of layoff, rather than losing all hope, they will quickly learn new skills that will help them find a job in another industry. This thirst for new experiences usually helps them as long as they are willing to learn something new along the way.

In my opinion, if everyone had lived their whole life in their comfort zone humanity would not have achieved the progress we enjoy today. Hence, I favour change as long as it is not destructive.

To conclude, people who are afraid of challenges or surprises want to stick to a routine. While there is nothing wrong with this approach, in my opinion, it is not particularly conducive to personal or professional growth. If we look around we can see that those who have achieved stupendous success in life are the ones who were never afraid of change. ",No,Yes,Yes,Yes,6.5

international tourism has become a huge industry in the world.some people think that the problems caused by internationaltourism outweigh the benefits.to what extant to you agree or disagree?,"With the advancement of the faster transportation system, especially air travel, people nowadays go to other countries for personal, business, recreational, official, health and educational purposes. The air travel is cheaper than the past and worldwide communication system, particularly Internet, has opened the doors of international tourism. An overwhelming number of tourists travel to different countries and this number is increasing every year. No doubt the international tourism is a very large industry and has many negative aspects. However, I believe that the advantages it offers well exceed the demerits it has.

First, due to the global trade, many companies have multiple offices in different geographical locations. Businessmen and office executives can these days visit other branch offices for their meeting, training and business needs. This opens the possibility of running a global business or working in a multinational company which has a huge positive impact on a country’s economy. International travel has made it possible for some medium entrepreneurs and business owners to expand their business opportunity beyond the border. For instance, a huge number of medium-size importers nowadays from my country visit China and some European countries to personally explore the business opportunity there. They even get some business ideas by visiting these countries and can make arrangement to export locally made goods. This, in my opinion, is a great advantage that the international travel offers.

Second, people can go to a country where medical treatment is better than his own country. For instance, a large number of people visit developed countries each year for better treatment and this is a positive development that ensures quality healthcare for many people. Similarly, people travel to other countries to enjoy their holidays and this is a great opportunity for learning about diverse cultural aspects. With the increasing international tourism industry, people have the better understanding of foreign cultures and it helps to reduce the gap among nations. This is an important aspect of maintaining world peace as more people travel and experience other cultures, more their misunderstanding about others reduces. Finally, the tourism industry has created a huge job opportunity and countries like Maldives, the Bahamas, Thailand, Indonesia, Anguilla, Aruba and Macau depends on this industry.

On the other hand, international tourism has some negative aspects that cannot be overlooked. Damages in biodiversity, increasing environment damage, more garbage production, the influence of foreign culture and threats of terrorism are some aspects that the booming international tourism industry creates. The amount of danger the air-fuel causes is an alarming issue for many environmentalists.

In conclusion, the massive international tourism industry and ever-increasing international travels have some environmental, cultural and terrorism-related issues. However, the opportunity and potentiality it has already created far outweigh the disadvantages of it. I believe that in this era of globalization international travel is a timely demand that will increase with time. ",No,No,Yes,Yes,6
More children in developed countries are becoming overweight. This is a serious problem for wealthy countries. Discuss some causes and effects of this problem. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowle,"Nowadays, youths are putting more fats on their bodies, which is becoming problematics for developed nations. There are consequences associated with this burning issue and can be seen mostly in wealthy nations where accessibility of easy lifestyle without sweating much physically. I shall further discuss mingled problems and long-lasting causes rutted with obesity.

To start with, that juveline with the heavy body is suffering from many physical as well as mental drawbacks. Usually, in developed nations, minors are privileged by many indoor video games and indoor activity set-ups, which basically intend them to don not step out and explore other options of passing leisure time. Moreover, authorities are more conscious about the healthy eating habits of everyone out there. Most parents are working which in-result can not give their full attention in raising a kid, and kids themselves developed eating habits in whatever way they feel good and comfortable. In most cases, children are ended up consuming more calories and fat items in their tummy. To cite an example, in the US more than 80 percentage of children and dealing with more weight than what is recommended by the world health organization.

Taking everything into consideration, before it will become a more serious problem authorities and parents must step forward and their collective efforts can eradicate the issue by setting new standards by the government as well as giving more attention to the children by their parents.

"In some schools and universities, girls choose arts subjects (literature), and boys tend to choose science subjects (physics). Why do you think this is so? Should this tendency be changed?","Science subjects are for boys and arts subjects are for girls. Gender based stereotypes exist everywhere. When we hear the word doctor, the first image that comes to our mind is that of a man wearing a white coat. Women can also become doctors and engineers. There are numerous of them. Countless women have already proved that they can excel in science subjects. Still, many girls opt for arts subjects at university. There are many reasons behind this trend.

One of the reasons that encourage many girls to choose arts is that they are not very keen on getting a job. They just want to earn a degree. As a result they decide to study literature or humanities. It is also easy to obtain admission to these courses because they are less competitive. By contrast, girls who really want to find employment after completing their education prefer to study science or maths. They become successful doctors, engineers and scientists.

Generally speaking subjects like science and technology generate more jobs than arts. This is exactly the reason that prompts boys to choose these subjects. All of them want to get a job and hence they choose scientific and technical subjects that improve their employability.

In my opinion, there is nothing wrong with girls choosing arts and boys choosing science. If a girl is not interested in working after university, she probably has no reason to obtain a degree in medicine or engineering. In my country, I know countless girls who prefer to stay at home looking after their children in spite of having a degree in computer science or physics. They actually deprived another student of an opportunity to become a scientist or a programmer.

To conclude, if girls prefer arts subjects to science subjects, that is because of the existence of gender stereotypes and their lack of interest in finding employment. In my opinion, this trend is neither positive nor negative and as such it does not have to be changed.

The promoters of social media claim that they are connecting people and enabling people to share like never before. While critics claim that social media site often impinges upon one’s privacy. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"It is often discussed by many social media influencers that they help humans connect to their loved one visually, but on the other hand it is told that it peaks into user’s personal information. Before concluding I would like to discuss both the sides below.

Firstly, social websites often help us to reach out to people virtually at any time. These platforms also let us share huge information in many ways and one can know what’s happening all around the world. For instance, when we take WhatsApp, a platform which is very helpful to us connecting people who are distant and make us spend time with them. We can also share our pictures and stories which are happening currently in our life’s, making our loved one’s and friends know.

However, there are sites which are harmful and are not secured to our personal life’s. These websites take our info which may lead to cybercrimes. Currently, it is burning news that, Facebook is now not secured because of their changes in data privacy and security field. This may show us few relatable advertising in different ways which we are often sharing in the same platform. Since, cyber-attacks often happen because attackers use this private information and pictures we post, which make people to often feel timid.

To conclude, I would like to share that our presence in social platforms does not make our target to cybercrimes. Though it is often recommended not to share any personal information in these sites and enjoy knowing the world virtually.",No,No,Yes,Yes,6
in what ways has technology affected the types of relationships people make?,"It is clear that advances in technology have influenced a lot of aspects of people's lives in the modern world. Due to the increasing of using technological devices, people could socialize with others in this way, instead of traditional methods. I completely agree with this statement, and in this essay, I will explain my view.

Before developing technology most people used to be getting well with others just in face-to-face situations such as in workplaces, in celebrations, or at social events. while it was easy for gregarious people to attend these associations, the others were losing an opportunity to make a new relationship. with the existence of technology devices and especially the virtual world, introverted or reserved individuals have a chance to interact with others and express their feeling without eye-contact, also with expanding of social media, people could possess easy access to other users in every place of the world and all day and night.

Another key feature is that in the modern world most people have to work hard to cover their living cost, so because of their hectic lifestyle, they do not have enough time to go out with friends, set an appointment with colleagues, or treat the family for a meal, so they prefer to use the internet for having contact with them and try to retain their relationships.

To sum up, while with extra use of technology the type of linking people has been changed, the quality of relationships has not been dropped. Even in my view technology leads to having a wide circle of friends for people. ",No,No,Yes,No,5.5
we are becoming increasingly dependent on computer-based technology. How do you think it will change in the future? Is it good for us to rely to much in computer?,"Since the launch of the first-ever computer, demand has steadily increased, as most of the institutions are dependent on this technology. Definitely, this will provide more opportunities for our future to grow, Some might argue if being so dependent on computer technology is beneficial to society,

First of all, computers were invented to make tasks easier. The first-ever computer was able to calculate complex formulas faster and more accurately as compared to humans, Furthermore, this progress was taken advantage of by companies, which installed computer systems in order to lessen the tedious job of auditing. As an example, all over the world, computers are seen on front desks and bank tellers, where it is utilized to store clients information and account statements.

Secondly, computer technology is now installed on modern vehicles, from motorcycles, cars, trains, airplanes, and space shuttles. Humans are now so reliant on computer systems that provide eco-friendly emissions from vehicles. As compared in the past vehicles back then are installed with carburetors, where it is said that use of such contributed to the destruction of the earth's ozone layer, from the high concentration of carbon emissions. But now, environmentalists claim that carbon emissions from cars had decreased because cars nowadays are installed with computer-driven fuel injection systems.

Finally, computer-dependent devices, provide safety to society. Government branches such as NASA and the weather bureau rely on computer technology for calculations of future forecasts. As an example, tsunami, earthquake, and typhoon warnings are more reliable, because installed systems with sensors can immediately send feedbacks to the main computer.

In conclusion, there are a lot of benefits in relying upon computer technology. Progress on the use of this technology is limitless.",No,Yes,Yes,No,6
Some people say that it is impossible for a country to be both economically successful and have a clean environment. Others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"There are many doubts regarding wealthy countries cannot guarantee keeping environment clean and healthy, while others oppose against it. In this essay I will discuss both views and state my own position.

On the one hand, there are many economically prosperous countries which suffers from pollutions to environment. To begin with, the main cause can be claimed for the heavy industries, which produce a great amount of exhausted fumes into the air. For example, Beijing is known as the most polluted cities, where due to the thick layer of smog citizens are forced to wear masks every day, in order to protect themselves from lung cancer. It also seems that outstanding economy attracts many investors and workers from all over the world. Subsequently, over-populated cities are in the higher risk from environmental damage, such as littering.

On the other hand, there are many economically successful countries, which balance economic and clean environment. Japan can be a good example of how government should manage separating trash and implementing policy, in order to turn rubbish into electricity. Beside from that, government officials put their efforts to raise awareness among residents, since they are at school. As a result, individuals realize the importance of healthy habitat, giving a hand to keep the country out of a danger.

In conclusion, it is not exaggerated to believe that country can avoid ecological cost of industrialization through prioritizing effective approaches of saving clean environment. I believe if government take right steps, there will be chance prevent many environmental issues.

"The number of people being sent to prison is increasing year by year. While some people believe prison is the best way to tackle crime, others suggest that community service is more successful. Discuss both views.","Increased number of people are being prisoned every year. Some would argue that community service shows more success, while others argue that only prison can help to alleviate crime. Even though working for the community can change criminal's mind, victim will not feel safe knowing that criminal is out there.

On the other hand, community service provides a great platform for a criminal to help others and gives an opportunity to be a better person again. Thus, their perspective towards society will change and consequently they will be less like to commit any crime again. For an instant, according to a research from Queen University suggest that 60% of criminals who provided community services are now living a normal life resulting in less number of crimes.

On the other hand, although community service may benefit criminal, it will be hard for victim to fill safe. There are chances that crime will be repeated again if the criminal is not imprisoned. Victim can live in a constant fear. For example, Leena will not be able to go out for anything as she was kidnapped during her childhood if she will have to see kidnappers in the community.

In conclusion, imprisoning the criminal is the only best way to reduce crime and community service is not an option as it is important for victim to feel secure.

Big salary is much more important than job satisfaction. Do you agree or disagree? Provide relevant examples if necessary.,"These days, it is often that people change their jobs according to their convenience which includes numerous factor such as salary, job satisfaction. Moreover, a plethora of employees recommend that job which has big money value but others prefer to work where they feel pleasure. According to my opinion, I partially agree with this idea and in this essay, I will support my opinion with relevant examples.

Firstly, people do hard work to earn good money. What I mean by this, to fulfill the basic requirement pupil do jobs and earn as enough as they handle their monthly expenses. For example, from last decade, people shifted their career option from teachers to business because educator has been paid below the average salary as compared to other professions. This will prove that society is more inclined toward money.

Another reason people why people want to join the high paid job due to the fact that the luxury world influences employees to a profitable job either it's below their qualification or discards working principle. To hold-up the above statement, office politics are common in present society because of money they received in form of rewards by letting co-workers down, which also reflects that money overcomes the ethics of work.

On contrary, a plethora of workers would like to achieve something unique in their own field so they become satisfied with their job and feel the happiness which can not be bought by money. The majority of individuals study in a different field but work in another subjective line that fetches the relief of satisfaction either they earn more.

In conclusion, working in an area where individuals feel fulfillment while working is a path to achievement and develop a good source of money. ",No,Yes,Yes,Yes,6.5

Advertising is influencing people more and more. Is this a positive or a negative trend? Give your own opinion and examples.,"Nowadays, we are increasingly surrounded by product or service advertisements. Although such competitive digital marketing like this, neither is entirely positive nor negative, in the eyes of me, it’s cons far outweigh the pros due to many consequences might have been followed from it regarding, impulsive buying and misrepresentation of facts.

Advertising, the most popular strategy for marketing, is known as a powerful psychological tool to influence on individuals buying behaviour. People are being marketed while they don’t even notice to the heart of the matter. The effects of advertising often work in subtle ways. In the first step, advertisement companies induce a short-term need for having their product in people’s mind, which seems to be rationally necessary, tempting them to purchase the good. As a matter of fact, these ads are designed to persuade customers making a purchase whether or not they planned ahead. The worldwide demand for buying the latest version of cellphones helps to clarify the problem. Annually we witness the endless queues of people who want to own the newest high-status device even if their previous works as well. This is what is coined impulsive buying as a negative result of ads.

In addition to illogical buying, sellers always trying to cover the dark side of their product and only highlight the positive characteristics to present a fault-free version of them. In this case, cigarette advertisements are such a good example which is worthy to mention here. Even in the primary cigarette ads has been mentioned how much it’s good for dental care! , ignoring it could extend beyond jeopardising human health and mainly causes lung cancer. Moreover, people are concerned about costs going up because of the advertisement expanse. The more a company promotes its products, the higher the cost per item should be paid which is heatedly debated among people why misleading advertising should be removed at all.

"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change,we need to find a way to live with it.","Climate change is problematic issue that we are not able to dodge. Some people consider that it is possible to get used to it and live with this acute problem. I strongly disagree with this opinion. Due to world problems such as deforestation, global warming, air pollution and so on and so forth, to my mind the only way to survive and tackle this problem is to start acting.

First of all, I reckon that people are not well-educated about this issue and do not know many things about consequences. They are not think twice before behave harmfully for Earth. Nowadays, in Antarctica thousand of ice melt. However, many people do not even notice it. From my point of view, govenmernt must conduct awareness campains with especially children. In schools there are no subjects where they can learn about the environment. About two years ago, in my country there was one event called ‘Survive the world’. The organizators of it collected money from people and then plented thousand of trees. Such kind of acts has little impact of climate but it is still necessary.

In my opinion, the easiest way to reduce air pollution is to mitigate the usage of cars. As individuals, much less people really need to commute by cars. We are able to utilize bicycles or public transport. It will have significant impact on Earth.

This issue is pretty controvertial and has two sides. In this essay I try to show both sides.

On the one hand, Inspite of different level’s classes, there are always dissimilar adults. Of course, being taught in mixed-ability classes could be advantages. First of all, weak child may imitate classmates and start studying well. For scholar it should be motivation to do more and more.

On the another hand, children who has big abilities are oppressed with relatively weak children. This situation interfere adult to concentrate on lesson. Children who are not eager to listen to teacher, they make noise without any sense. Teacher can teach them how to develop competitiveness and be more courageous. Furthermore, this kind of school may lead to the future. It will be complicated for them to find friends. This can have a negative impact on adult’s attitude to people. However, from my point of view it is better to strem classes only for their knowledge. May for a short while.

This is surrounded with so many controversies I undoubtedly agree. Different factor have influenced my stand in this matter. Out of the several observation the first which comes to my mind is that people are believed in communication much better in professional side. This view exits because people are basic facing for introductionary part for business, life and any time to any places. As a result good communication it's power of selling and personality far behind. Furthermore, we cannot ignore the reality that spoken communication to way of aeration from people it's a good skill to conve for any body. This reason is buoyed in the fact that people always followed in mentors. Consequently people are good in spoken communication it's a lots of benefits in real life. Moreover, everyone notice that writing it's a good effective for good personality even good communication. This factor is taken in to account as people are good communication in email, writing eassy. But in real face to face it's more not good in. Therefore, people writing communication must to related workes.

"In some countries, owning a home rather than renting one is very important for people","To begin with, the world is changing at a rapid pace and mankind attitudes to all subjects are changing too. People in different countries have various points of view, because the places they live in have their own distinctive environment.

On the one hand, taxing policy is different in every country and I believe that it has influence on society’s lifestyle. For instance, you don’t have to pay any additional taxes for owning a home in Georgia, however in the USA it is mandatory to pay high taxes for it. As a result, a reasonable number of society prefers to rent home than buy it, because it is much cheaper. My own experience is a compelling example of this. I’m citizen of the USA and Georgia simultaneously and I have property merely in Georgia. Furthermore, when you rent a flat you have less responsibilities, for example you don’t have to care about renovation, you just pay rent fee and everything goes smoothly.

However, this issue can be considered from the opposite angle. When you rent home for your entire life it can be said that you waste money, because you don’t have your own property and in comparison I prefer to pay more taxes and have my real estate than rent it. The life is full of unexpected moments and we may accidently need an excessive amount of money for our health problems and if we haven’t any property to sell, we won’t be able to settle this problem.

In my view, neither absolute freedom nor having no option could be beneficiary for children. In other words, kids should be given with a certain range of options to select between them.

Humans are constantly chosing in their entire life and all of these selections affect our lives more or less. There are consequents behind every single choice which everyone should be conserned of, even since the very early ages. Consequently, benevolent parents ought to let their children decide and see results of their decisions, in order to help their personalities and sense of moralities to develop.

However, we are living a life, surrounded by numerous limitations. As a result not everything we wish for would be provided in adulthood. Henceforth, providing everything for youngsters and every morsel of their wishes would spoil them and makes them acclimate to watching every wanting accepted. Further, meaning of wishes and hopes would eventually diminished and quenched as you see everything prepared.

To sum up, every human has the right to choose routine matters and even children shall not be deprived of this merit. However, kids might end up as inept and malevolent human beings in the future, in case of responding to every demand of them.",No,No,Yes,No,5
Some People Think That Art Is An Essential Subject For Children At School,"The art subject has become compulsory in almost every school. Some people think that it is an essential subject, but others opine that it is a waste of time. Even though both of them are correct to some extent, I think it should be an elective subject since not everyone is interested in arts.

Some people think that the art subject is important for children since it can improve them in several ways. Art will make children innovative and improve their concentration because it involves fun and also demands thinking. In other words, it enhances the creativity in children without putting them under stress. For example, playing flute involves fun and also they need to be innovative to compose their own music. Besides, they should memorize some techniques to master the instrument. Hence, the subject is good in making children innovative/creative and focused in an enjoyable way.

Secondly, art would help them to support themselves financially when they grew up. For example, if a child is good at playing a musical instrument, they can earn money in future by showcasing their skills. On the other hand, some people think that learning art is a waste of time. Not all students are good at arts, so it might not support them in future. So, they opine that investing time in a subject which is not going to help in future is a waste of time; instead/rather they should focus on subjects which attract them the most.

To sum up, in my opinion, whether or not a student should learn art depends on their interest. So, the institutions should make the art class as an elective subject; therefore, interested students can sign up according to their choice. ",No,No,Yes,Yes,6
"In some countries, an increasing number of people are suffering from health problems as a result of eating too much fast food. It is therefore necessary for governments to impose a higher tax on this kind of food. A ou agree or disagree?","Some people are struggling to health issues causes of eating too much fast food, which people cannot control their self on buying and eating. Therefore the government said that they will impose a higher tax on this kind of food. I agree in these statements because it will help to people to have a healthy body

Firstly people should cooked healthy food everyday to prevent having an unhealthy body. Preparing healthy diet foods helps to reduce on buying and eating fast food and it decrease the number of young people to have interest for it. Younger-age should teach how important of eating healthy food. Giving lectures and showing that healthy food is good to everyone, the young people will encourage to eat and they will not ask to buy or eat the fast food.

Secondly, increasing the taxes on the fast food, authorities helps to people to avoid on having interest on eating unhealthy food. In every government people should not allow to made a business like fast food because it is not necessary on helping people’s health. It is cause of having a disease like increasing of cholesterol, high blood and high blood sugar.

In conclusion to reduce the number of an unhealthy body in every country they should give more interest on eating healthy food. Giving higher taxes give limitation on purchasing of fast food and every citizen will continue to eat healthy diet food. It will avoid on having some diseases that will be a reason on being unhealthy. Healthy body helps every one to stay longer. ",No,No,Yes,No,5
"In the past, most people used to travel to their place of work. With increased use of computers, the internet and smart phones, more and more people are starting to work from home. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this development?","In the 20th century, there is a significant changes of the way people working. In the past, most of people need to travel to their work place however, because of technology advance most people start to work from their home. In my opinion, the development will generate the advantages and disadvantages for human being and these point of view will be discussed below.

Furthermore, there are many advantages from the advance of technology in the work place especially with this development people being allowed to work from their home. First, the flexibility of working hours and place therefore, people are not strict with office hours however, they still need to be on schedule to finish their works. Second, people do not waste their time to travel to the work place especially for who those lived far away from the company. For instance, because of traffic jam in Jakarta, people need to travel more than an hour for only within 10 km which waste a lot of time. Third, people have more chance to work and communicate with a company partner from different country through the internet.

On the other hand, work from home also generate disadvantage for human life. First, this development will be impacted to the productivity of workers. The productivity will be declined as there are many distraction from surroundings. For example people has to deal with their kids, house work and many else therefore, people will not focus to do their jobs from home and results negative performance for the company. In addition, work at home will generate less social interaction and will lead to someone stress and loneliness.

In conclusion, there are many different advantages and disadvantages that generated from work from home. It is suggested for people to have a work life balance to face this development due to avoid the negativity from the development. ",No,No,Yes,Yes,6
The advantages and disadvantages of living in a foreign country,"Everyone in the world thought about their dream job. Some people want to work in big companies, build a successful career, but others dream about own business, enterprises. There are advantages and disadvantages of being your own boss.

Firstly, having your own business has many positive sides. One of the main benefits is that you can bring all your ideas to life. When something new comes to your mind, in any case you can make it in real life. Business sphere is one of the spheres where you can expresses yourself, feel independence and have creative freedom and personal satisfaction. Secondly, you can control your salary. In business, boss chooses salary for all workers, it is very easy, because you can look at performance of workers and decrease or increase amount of salary.

Beside the advantages, being your own boss has many negative sides. One of the main disadvantages it is big risks. People take a risk when wants to open own enterprise, because there are no base and confidence for the future. Dreams can become to nightmare without working hard, financial investments and good service. Secondly, you always need to improve your business with new ideas and investments. Enterprise will start bring a less amount of money and become boring without any improvements. Therefore, if you want to be businessmen, you need to have good workers that will help you to develop enterprise.

Finally, having your own business and be your own boss have many benefits and opposites. In my opinion, create your own enterprise is it a huge opportunity and every businessmen went through difficulties. ",No,No,Yes,No,5
Housing is essential for people. Some argue that the government should offer free housing for people who cannot afford it. To what extent Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"The stress level among the lives of different age categories is debatable. Some school of thought believe that, contemporary younger adult face more stress lives due to sophisticated educational system, while other oppositions believe that, the former generational teenagers were more prone to stress due to inevitable farming for survival. This essay will discuss both views. In my opinion, I believe that, the former generations were faced with more stressful living than the present teenagers.

Several people believe that complex educational system has caused more stress. Schools engage their teen students with complex subjects like, physics and chemistry, especially in their secondary schools which build up stress in them when they try to assimilate all. For example, a report given recently about college in Nigeria, stated that, although the syllabus in schools are usually completed, the stress level of students are shown to be at its peak because of consistent study. Thus, many people believe education in recent times, have added more stress for teenagers in their schools, whereas, former generational teenagers will not face this stress because most of them, either do not regard school because they do not see the value or they cannot afford it.

Conversely, farming for survival was essential in the early 90s for teenagers to survive. Many teenagers engage in farming, as well as their parents to meet their daily bread which involves physical and tedious effort that can lead to stress. For example, many teenagers in the 19th century were involved in tedious farming. The absence of modernized technology, such as tractor, were not available, leaving them with the choice of engaging in manual labour, which is more stressful and can lead to anxiety. Thus, teenagers of the past, faced more stressful living than present teenagers.

In conclusion, some school of thought believe that, present teenagers face more stressful lives than older generation due to the complex educational structure they go through, while other opposition disagrees. In my opinion, I believe that, the previous teenagers lived a more stressful life than the present. ",No,Yes,Yes,Yes,6

Many student chooseto take a gap year before starting university, to travel or ain work experience. Do you think this is a goodidea or waste of time?","Now a days student choose gap year after graduate from high school going to travel for have work experience. I want to explain which this issue is useful for students. in my idea best way to develop experience.

First of all gap year is good opportunity to learn more skill and knowledge at the same time. also they going to travel to their country or an other country. This way is very useful for their, because they can learn a lot of experience and knowledge about that country or city. in addition students learn about culture, local food, local treditional and many and useful experience. on the other hand when they found a their job relate to educations. Because, at the same times they doing favorite word and also earn money. That is very useful for their future.

On the other hand student, just have a one job, who their favorite and only earn money. for example, some times when student, travel to an other place they have to have job as soon as possible. Because more than maybe under high pressure and they have to have a jast job. But in my opinion this way is useful too. It is correct that job is not relate to the field of study but they can earn money and have diferent experience. such as work in shopping center or another jobs however this way is great for have experiace for future.

Housing is essential for people. Some argue that the government should offer free housing for people who cannot afford it. To what extent Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"Accommodation is vital in providing stability to individuals, and for this reason, some school of thought are of the perception that shelter be made available at no cost to humans who cannot afford it. I partially agree and disagree with this notion for a number of reasons.

On the one hand, issuing shelters to homeless individuals enhance safety and security. A vast majority of hoodlums and thugs are human beings without homes who have found solace in residing on the street. These individuals overtime learn how to disrupt the peace of their neighborhood by breaking laws and causing violent act such as stealing, gambling and fighting which could even lead to loss of lives. For this reason, providing them with suitable apartments at no cost would tremendously decrease such crimes by reducing the number of people residing on the street. For instance, during the end sars protest held in Nigeria, in 2020, many businesses were vandalized and looted by hoodlums making entrepreneurs loose their investment.

On the other hand, allocating homes freely to individuals would reduce revenue generated by government agencies. One major method of generating funds used to effectively manage an economy is by collecting tax from various economical sectors such as housing. This implies that the income received by the authorities would drastically decline after giving houses freely to individuals and this can have a negative effect on the society. Furthermore, landed properties required for constructing industries and estate with the aim of generating funds for the society, would be diverted into building homes, thereby further reducing societal income.

To conclude, I partially agree and disagree that houses should be given without charge to homeless people because although it can help increase safety and security in an economy, it can also drastically reduce the earnings of a society. ",No,Yes,Yes,Yes,6.5

There are several television channels telecasting various types of music. Early morning, people love to hear soft melodies and prayer songs. People believe this is a great way of starting their day more energetically. Before going to sleep they love to hear at least few good night songs to relax and to get a sound sleep.

The advantages and disadvantages of owning a pet.,"Many people dream about having a pet. Some of them cannot have opportunity because of allergy, money or kids, but others make their dreams come true. There are advantages and disadvantages of owning a pet.

First of all, owning a pet has many good sides. One of them is it that pet destroy loneliness and helps with depression. Any pet fill the void in the soul, cats and dogs always meet their owners after work, school or university. Especially if men live alone, pets do not make them feel lonely. Secondly, you can direct your love and care to pets. All animals that live in human`s house need a big cares and a lot of attention. Therefore, if you have not friends or lover, you can look after pets.

Beside advantages, there are many negative sides. Firstly, animals often get sick. Pets are very gentle creatures and they need special cares. Treatment in a veterinary clinic very expensive, therefore some owners of pets, leave their animals to death. Secondly, many pets lose their wool. Cats, dogs, parrots, etc. have a special season where they starting to shed. For owners it is very bad news, because they need to clean up carpets, clothes every day.

Should the international community do more to tackle the threat of global warming?,"The question of, if advanced countries should put more effort tackling the challenge of global warming is debatable. In my opinion, I believe, modernized community must ensure that extra effort is being adopted to solve the threat because of more complex machines that can cause serious pollution and alter climatic conditions.

Complex machines in international society can cause tremendous pollution. The fumes emanating from these machines, consistently compete with the level of oxygen in the air which results in lesser oxygen for mankind in these areas. In addition, other poisonous gases are being released which can be carcinogenic and can further lead to death of humans. For example, In mid 90s, carbon from high technology generators used in Korea, led to the depletion of oxygen level in the society which lead to a serious catastrophe. Thus, it is of great essence that, international countries must do more to halt the negative effect of global warming.

Also, sophisticated technology can alter climatic conditions in international societies. The use of aircraft and other modernized commuters can deplete the ozone layer which can further affect climatic conditions. For example, black fumes from complex commuters produced in Japan, led to a tremendous increase in tropical weather due to the depletion of the ozone layer that consequently caused an increase radiation from the sun. Thus, complex machines such as cars, trains, aircraft, can inadvertently cause a disaster in weather condition.

In conclusion, the question of, if international countries should put more effort in tackling global warming is debatable. In my opinion, I believe it is pertinent for modernized countries to ensure more effort is required to tackle global warming because of more complex machines that can either result in pollution or alter climate conditions.

As a result of increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in atmosphere, temperature on the Earth grow, ice melting, warming Ocean, sea level rising. Also, people around the world lose their homes, jobs, businesses, loss crops because of consequences of global warming.

Secondly, as result of road accident, every year millions of people die. In many countries road traffic is undeveloped. For instance: dangerous or broken roads between cities and countries. Additionally, only 15% of all countries can provide citizens with safe road traffic.

a balanced diet is the key to a healthy life. what is your opinion about it?,"A balanced diet means a diet that provides all the necessary vitamins and minerals required for a human body to grow properly. According to me, eating balanced meals is important and crucial for a healthy life, but we should also supplement it with other healthy habits. I will discuss this in details in the next paragraph.

Eating well balanced diets can take us very close to a healthy life but it will also require some other elements to fully impact our health. Exercising and doing physical activities is of outmost importance to extract full benefits of a balance diet. The vitamins, proteins, fibers etc. provide us with all the required energy, but it wont keep our internal organs, our muscles and our brain in perfect condition without the help of good physical activities. Walking, swimming and running are some good exercises that can aid us to achieve a healthy body and mind. In addition to this, a good daily routine is also necessary to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Good sleep hours, routine intake of meals and proper rest should work in tandem to keep our body in sublime condition. Moreover, a stable and blissful state of mind is another pivotal element in the journey towards a healthy life that often get neglected.

A balanced diet is the first step in the long walk to a healthy and happy life. We should follow a well worked out routine together with eating good foods and keep at it till the end.

Individuals can do nothing to improve the environment; only governments and large companies can make a difference. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In the 21st century, the pollution caused by humanity has adversely impacted the environment. Argueably, numerous people believe that only the Governments and the big corporates can alleviate the atmosphere on Earth and they alone cannot do it. I completely disagree with this statement, as the individual contribution is equally essential to bring a significant change in our surroundings.

A plethora of people understimates their own capability when it comes to aiding our planet. Healing the entire globe may feel like an overwhelming task to any person at the beginning, as small families often lack the resources interms of time and money to bring significant difference in their own neighbourhoods. For instance, a middle-class family would not think of cleaning up a beach as they cannot afford to spend time on such social activities. Thus, a large population are lacking self belief to help the changing climate.

On the otherside, Governments and large companies as a part of their enviromental resposibility acts are putting efforts to bring a positive change. Though these giant organisations have been implementing policies to cut down emissions and planting trees, it is hardly compensating for the wastes being generated. As an example, Indian government has brought numerous policies into action related to enviroment but since the population is enormous, the aftermath is negligible. So, Corporates and Governments alone fails to create an impactful enviromental aid.

The consistent rise in population and human needs continues to degrade our land. Governments and Companies were believed to be the only hope for improvement and single human is considered insignificant. I profoundly disagree to this statement because individuals needs to support comparably same as organisations.",No,Yes,Yes,yes,6

But others believe that animals are their to satisfy their basic needs like food and research. I would expound both the views including my opinion in the upcoming paragraph.

On one hand, people believe that one should not hurt animals and should be given equal rights. Firstly, their are people who like to worship animals. Moreover, in Indian religion animals are considered to be the image of God so they are treated like humans only. Secondly, there are various animals conservation act launched by the government to protect animals. Thirdly, in US people treat animals as their family members and take them where they go. According to a survey by a leading newspaper, more than 50 percent of people are fond of animals and have animals in their home.

On other hand, some people opine differently. They believe that animals are their to fulfill their needs. First of all, people hurt animals. To add on, they are killed in the slaughter houses to get meat and other stuff like leather. In Industries various items like coats, shoes, belt, ectectra are made from killing animals. Second of all, animals are used in various research laboratories. Additionally, when they want to detect some disease monkeys DNA are used to found the basic root cause of problem.

Pondering over the topic, although many people use animals to fulfill their basic needs like food, clothes, and in research also, but I firmly believe that animals should be given equal right as humans and we should take care of them by helping them when they are in pain. ",No,No,Yes,No,5

Some people opine that those who work in the field of education, healthcare should pay more money because they are contributed a lot to humanity compare to actress or actors company leaders. This essay will explore and discuss important of health specialists and pedagogical experts in humanity, compare to pay more money to famous people who do nothing for other people.

To begin with, the first reason why I agree that those who are working in a crucial field, such as in hospitals and schools should value them and pay much money is due to humanity. Doctors and nurses, for example, they are sacrificing the whole their life for a human being. Therefore, both governments and head of hospitals not only appreciate their work but also increase monthly income.

Secondly, teachers have been working traditionally in the field of education. In this case, they have a right to pay more money from the government but should be back up or support from the legislators and society widely. A good example is Poland, which teachers and well-being workers support financially from the government including facilities like accommodation, and transportation.

In contrast, actors and actress company leaders should not pay more money because they are just entertainers. Their contribution is not effective and efficient as doctors and teachers. Therefore, it is reasonable if payment for those who are working for public interests than for well-known filmmakers or actors.

In conclusion, I believe that there are a plethora of criteria to pay for these people, yet governments support and society's desires on payment can be completely important. ",Yes,Yes,Yes,yes,7

As a result, it's easier for him to recall details about the concert.

Second, unusual characteristics in a subject. When there is an unusual characteristic it's easier for us to remember them. The process provides an example of a big class to illustrate this. After a year we can remember only people that are unusual, tall or very smart people.

"Some people think that young people should spend their free time with their families instead of enjoying outside entertainment. However, others disagree. Discuss both views and give your opinion","Family is the single most important influence in children’s life and for this reason, some individuals believe that youngsters should allocate their leisure hours to their households, rather than been engaged in outdoor amusements, while others think otherwise. I, however, support the view that engaging in outdoor activities is a better idea.

On the one hand, offsprings spending spare time with relatives enhance unbreakable bonds. This is achieved by boosting better understanding, tolerance and acceptance of one another, leading to less disagreement, and violent acts amongst household which eventually strengthen bonds. For instance, spending more time with my dad especially from childhood has significantly increased my understanding of him, and my affection towards him more than any other member of family.

On the other hand, it is my opinion that participating in outdoor relaxation is better as it increases one’s network and social skills. This is due to the fact that this individuals are more opportune to come across various individuals who eventually become friends that could be relevant to the growth of their career, by connecting them to important partners. Furthermore, they are able to interact with numerous people from different aspect of lives which further enhances their communication and social skills.

So whatever they are being thaught in this age is going to reflect in the charecteristic of the child. Now a days since most parents being overprotective on their child, there is high possiblity of the child being misguided and grow in a wrong path. So the teachers can be the only saviours for shaping the phsycological behaviour of a child. There is famous leader who is great example of how a child future depends on their teacher. Dr. Ambethkar who was inspired by his teacher who taught him inequality is a sin, the thing which he learnt in his childhood make a change in the society when he gerw up.

The skills are equally important as the social behaviour, In this highly competitive world. Improvising the talents and knowledge are highly essential for their success in future. The teachers play a crucial role in this aspect, assessing the ability of the child the teachers require to provide the specific training to students.

There is also an another popular example for this scenario, Dr. Abdul Kalam who was guided by his lecturer in his school seeing his intrest toward Aerospace later he became the most loved person of all the people.

Even though the teacher play a vital role in shaping the future of the child, Parents also holds a considerable portion. The parents should provide the insights of which is right and which is not. With a good teacher and a sensible parent the future of child with no doubt will be exceptional. ",No,No,Yes,No,5
"Many children in rural places cannot have good schools and medical facilities. Some people suggest that new teacher and doctors should be sent to rural places for serval years. Others, however, believe everyone has the right to choose where to work. To what extent do you agree?","Rural areas, the world over, experience backwardness in education and health care. This prompts many to propose that fresh teachers and doctors should be deputed to remote areas for long periods of time, which is opposed by others on grounds of human rights to choose where they work. While there are valid arguments on both sides, this essay does not wholly agree with the latter view.

At the outset, every human being has a few fundamental rights. The right to choose an occupation and the place of work are a few of the main human rights. Although, people working as teachers and doctors are expected to be empathetic, in a true democracy, they cannot be forced to work at a place against their will. However, governments spend a lot of money for education and training of citizens. In such a situation, governments have the right to direct citizens to discharge some duties for the welfare of the underprivileged.

Further, rural communities have equal rights in a democracy and depriving them of adequate education and health care is a violation of their rights. Furthermore, if large numbers of people leave their villages for cities in search of better educational and health care facilities, it will upset the developments of the economy and worsen problems of unplanned urbanization, which is experienced by many developing countries in today's world.

In short, a democratic government cannot evade its responsibility from providing welfare to its citizens. People in rural areas have as much claim to welfare activities as any other set of people. By giving adequate remuneration and other benefits for doctors and teachers, governments can encourage them to mitigate the sufferings of those living in villages.

"Some people argue such as mobile phones, are making people socially less interactive. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Socializing among people, in this contemporary era, is being affected by discoveries in technology. Does the argument that it is making people more reclusive hold any logic? Considering the reduced distances between people, the availability of effective features with the find the above argument to be flawed.

Modern gadgets have enabled people to contact their acquaintances living in far-flung areas. This because of the inventions of not only real-time messaging are in touch the comfort of their homes. Had discoveries they would have to either take leaves from their hectic schedules maintain their bonds or the relations would have weakened. However, of technology not limited to increasing the range of communication.

Communication has also been made more effective by technology. With the help of emoticons changing the format of a text, people, nowadays, can convey their messages in a clearer manner, was not possible when the only plain text was sent through letters. For instance, one can bold underline a part of the text on which the reader's is required. Even the language barriers are disappearing with the help of translators.

Along with the above merits on a personal level, people can also communicate well professionally, Both more opportunities terms of conducting training or interviews over new applications, such passing information, like sending audio-visual along with electronic mails, are present now. Consequently, it has improved the level of formal communication, too.

In conclusion, better communication among people's personal and professional lives has been made possible by modern gizmos; therefore, I am strongly convinced that socialization in modern civilization has not been adversely affected technology.",No,Yes,Yes,Yes,7
Many people believe that social networking sites (such as Facebook) have a huge negative impact on both individuals and society. To what extent do you agree?,"In this Global Village, where everyone is connected through these Social Apps like Facebook, etc, have an undesirable effect on people and society, I disagree with that, reason being, these platforms connect the distant loved ones and these networks influence the society in a positive way.

I would support my argument starting with those individuals who are away from their loved ones, working in different countries, at the end of the day, the only way they can connect to their friends and families is only through these social networking sites, they can interconnect with each other through posts, photos, and video calls. These applications have shortened the distances in many ways and most people feel fulfilled to have them in their lives.

Now, with in no seconds, we can know what is happening in other parts of the world, we can watch them live, see their traditions and cultures. We can work with each other, share our virtual workspace and we can now support humanity in many ways. Social media is the new way of connecting and these sites bring more good than bad. Though they have an adverse impact in some ways, but this paradigm shift can never be neglected.

I conclude that, social networking applications have changed the architecture of connecting and they bring more accomplishment to individuals and society. They are now becoming part of everyone and are beneficial in plenty of ways not only connecting all of us but also bringing a shift when it comes to the workspace.",No,No,Yes,no,5
Many people believe that social networking sites (such as Facebook) have a huge negative impact on both individuals and society. To what extent do you agree?,"Social networking websites like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram have become an important part of our everyday life. However, it is argued that these sites have a devastating effect on the community and the individuals. I strongly agree with the thought that social websites have a profound negative effect.

To begin with, social networking sites have started hurting relationships. In the present world, people spend a lot of time online. Hence, they do not have time to visit their friends or relatives. As a result, relationships have become shallow. For example, in the earlier days, individuals used to have get-togethers at least once a month, but nowadays most of the people do not even know many of their relatives. Consequently, there are no close helpful relationships in this era.

Addiction is another drawback of social networks which leads to failure in almost every field. Most of the people waste hours in front of computers or mobile phones chatting and posting on Facebook and Twitter and thus they fail to pay attention to their work. For instance, students do not perform their best in the exams or fail because they spend more time online instead of studying. As a result, social networking sites hinder the progress of the individual and also of the society.

In conclusion, although Facebook and such sites are beneficial to some extent, I strongly agree with the argument that they have more detrimental effect on both the local community and the people. It is hoped that users will realize this and learn to use such platforms more judiciously.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,7
"Some people prefer to spend their lives doing the same things and avoiding change.Others,however,think that change is always a good thing. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","In this world, every humankind need a small change with their life. However, some individuals choose to do same things with their whole life and escape the change. While, others opine that change life is more useful for all the time. Before reaching to any suitable conclusion both sides of the given notion will be discussed in the following paragraphs.

Glancing on one side, some people believe that they spend their lives with avoiding changes which gives some positive impacts. Firstly, people get more comfortable and easy life to stick on same things rather than any changes. To illustrate, every person gets chance to take more opportunities in their jobs. Also, they can gain more knowledge and high salary in same field. Secondly, by avoiding the changes in life people can easily live without any fear of difficulties in their life.

On the flip side, people spend their lives with some new things. Primarily, people get chance to enhance their experience in different fields while they change some activities in their life. To exemplify, every person with new change gets a lot of opportunities in different fields as well as they can learn several skills for their career. Secondarily, every humankind learns about some multiple tasks of their life. Also, sometimes they are aware about their concentration on circumstances of their life.

To recapitulate, from my perspective, people should get a small change in their daily life, which is more beneficial than escaping the changes in life. As I believe that people can easily enhance their experience and grow up with their career. Hence, the change is always a crucial factor of every mankind's life. ",No,Yes,Yes,no,6
Influence of human beings on the world's ecosystem is leading to the extinction of species and loss of bio-diversity. What are the primary causes of loss of bio-diversity? What solutions can you suggest?,"Despite knowing about biodiversity’s importance for a long time, human activity has been causing massive extinctions of different species. This essay will examine the main causes of loss of biodiversity and possible solutions of this problem.

The two main causes of species extinction are change of their habitats and overexploitation of natural resources. When humans artificially transform the environment, they destroy vegetation and animals’ natural habitat. For instance, to build new roads people are cutting down the trees and cementing the soil, altering the environment. Because of that, a lot of species are dying out. Also, when the activities connected with capturing and harvesting a natural resource are too intense in a particular area, the resource becomes exhausted. For example, too frequent fishing doesn’t leave enough time for fish to reproduce and makes them disappear. In other words, human activities often deplete local flora and fauna and cause loss of bio-diversity.

Some possible solutions to this problem are protecting natural areas and promoting awareness among people. By protecting areas where human activity is limited and avoiding overexploitation of its resources, we can save the untouched environment and prevent species from dying out. Moreover, the next step in fighting bio-diversity loss is informing the general population about the dangers of this problem. This way, people will be more conscious of the environment and won’t overuse or destroy its resources.

To conclude, people’s activities that change the environment have negative impact on the world's ecosystem. However, we can significantly lessen the extinction of species by protecting natural areas and enlightening people as to this problem. ",Yes,Yes,yes,yes,7

To commence with, by learning foreign languages in school curricullum put extra pressure on students because they have to learn other subjects which are far more important to learn due to importance of these subjects. They are not able to devote full time to other subjects. As a result, e cannot achieve good grades during exams.

Similarly, by learning foreign languages hamper the physical growth of students because they do not have enough time to play outdoor activities. Ultimately, they loose their fitness level. They have to work for extra hours to learn grammer, vocabulary and other alphabets of these languages which is not a easy task. Hence, it may have adverse effect on their mental health. On the other hand, by learning new foreign languages help to enhance carrier prospective. Nowadays, many companies demands employees who know more than one languages because they want to work in foreign nations. Many multinational companies like Audi, BMW and other American firms demand bilingual employees so that they can work in other nations.

It is advisable that foreign languages can be learn in later part of life. ",No,No,yes,no,5
"In some countries, an increasing number of people are suffering from health problems as a result of eating too much fast food.

Therefore the government said that they will impose a higher tax on this kind of food. I agree in these statements because it will help people to have a healthy body.

Nowadays people are interested in many fast food which is not healthy to their body. It is easy to on making order and they did not waste too much time on cooking. In contrast they did not know that the food they eat is not clean and its harmful to their health. In this case cooking a healthy food everyday prevent having an unhealthy body. Preparing healthy diet foods helps to reduce on interest in buying and eating fast food. People should teach how important of eating healthy food. Giving lectures and showing that healthy food is good to everyone, everyone will encourage to eat and they will not ask to buy or eat the fast food.

Secondly, increasing the taxes on the fast food, authorities helps people to avoid having interest in eating unhealthy food. In every government people should not allow to make a business like fast food because it is not necessary for helping people health. It is cause of having a disease like increasing cholesterol, high blood and high blood sugar.

In conclusion to reduce the number of unhealthy bodies in every country they should give more interest on eating healthy food. Giving higher taxes give limitations on purchasing fast food and every citizen will continue to eat healthy diet food. It will avoid having some diseases that will be a reason for being unhealthy.

Some people say that Ebooks and modern technology will totally replace traditional newspaper and magazines to what extent do you agree or disagree.,"Technology is flourishing by leaps and bounds and providing us new avenues while keeping ourselves updated with the latest news and current affairs. Therefore, a fair amount of people believe, a conventional way of newspaper reading will be disappeared. I do not completely accord with it because a conventional newspaper is an easiest and cheapest way to get news. To embark on, there are multiple reasons why the traditional ways of getting news are still popular. First of all, reading newspaper has become the ardent habit of many people. Everyone whether from affluent or middle class are seen desperately waiting for paper in morning and enjoy it reading with a cup of tea.

Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some ideas exist that youngsters could contribute their spare time to work volunteering for society. I totally agree with that opinion as there are a lot of young people who consume their time for unhealthy activities. This essay will discuss why teenagers must join with community tasks.

To begin with, teenagers have good health and sharp minds to help their communities. To make it clear, this means the age of 15 to 22 years old is regarded as puberty with well-being and creativity. They can learn fast and use their power to assist others. For example, a young teen might spend their time after school to go to a nursing home or hospital and support the staff to run errands. Clearly, the youngster is stronger and smarter than other ages, therefore they should give a hand to people who are living around them.

Additionally, these growing people are developing their life skills, thus, it is crucial to volunteer and correct their demerits. Nowadays, there are a bunch of teenagers who prefer spending their leisure time on computer and smartphone without interacting with other people. This shapes their personalities and cognition to be slow and dependable. However, if they go outside and collaborate with others, they definitely pick up on a variety of useful lessons. For instance, a youngster who would like to volunteer for daycare, she probably can gain some skills of taking care of kids and others. Thus, volunteering benefits each individual if they aspire to perfect their moralities.

In conclusion, contributing effort for the community brings many advantages for young people, and helps them to establish their goals in the future. ",Yes,Yes,yes,yes,7

However, some individuals suggest that every child must not be taught by their parents at home. From my perspective, i completely agree with the given notion and my view on the facts will be elaborated further in the following paragraphs.

First of all, when students are sent to the school by their family, this decision gives a giant impact on their educational life. Primarily, children gains more knowledge at school with different faculties rather than home schooling. To illustrate, parents are unable to teach every subjects in one day, but if students are taught by any experts then they can learn several subjects at a time. Secondarily, every student becomes more communicative with other people in their life. As they learnt by various professors they knows how to solve a multiple tasks.

Moreover, every student gets higher facilities for their practical education if they not prefer to do home schooling. To examplify, students can use the variety of equipments for hardware and software applications in their practical study. Which they are not be able to use at home. Lastly, children kept out from their home for better study, they can use one additional facility of library for their concentration, which gives a huge focus in their education.

To recapitulate, home education gives a wide impact on child's education. Hence, I strongly believe that students should be learnt at school or by professional experts. As they provides better education for their career which is helpful for them in many crucial ways of life. Therefore, they becomes more communicative and competitive in this modern education trend.

More and more people today are drinking sugar-based drinks. What are the reasons for this? What are the solutions?,"Nowadays, more and more individuals are becoming obsessed with sugar-based drinks. This problem is more aggravated for the younger generation who literally replace water in favour of sweety drinks. In the given essay, I will highlight two main reasons for the outstanding problem and then provide ways to mitigate the ongoing concern.

First and foremost, soft drinks provide people with a sense of joy and delightfulness. It is well investigated that the sugar in component positively affects the dopamine level in the body of a person. Increase in this hormone forces the person to feel “happier”. Hence, as individuals feel themselves better, they purchase more of sweety products.

Another reason behind high levels of consumption of sugar-products, specifically soft-drinks, is an over-consumption behaviour of modern society. In fact, the majority of generation Y and Z advocates that soft-drinks is an essential component of any party or other special occasions. That is, the standards of any event are based on the fact that whether or not snacks and beverages were offered. This behaviour, in turn, makes people buy more of these products.

The most effective way to surmount the problem of sweet-drinks addiction is to constantly notify people of an adverse impact of sugar. The beverages, such as Coke and Pepsi, contain a great amount of sugar components which causes the deterioration of brain cells as well as muscular structure. Furthermore, a sugar addiction may lead to obesity problems, which many young adults encounter nowadays. The government should start a sugar-free campaign and share the effects of sugar and beverages through online and offline channels, including social media and advertisements.

In conclusion, there are several causes of people drinking sweety drinks. The problem, however, lies deeply in the mindset of individuals who, possible, do not know the negative effects of sugar. So, in order to effectively overcome this issue, the local authorities should rise awareness among the folk to the very great extent.",no,yes,yes,yes,6

Furthermore, weather could also be a cause for changing mood in people.

A research discussed there's a correlation between colors and student learning behavior. Color cues could affect student's blood pressure which leads to some chemical reaction occurs in the brain that enables them to feel certain mood, which eventually would improve student's focus. For instance, students who have tendency to see the color green is proven to have a capability to keep a long-term concentration and clarity when it comes to math subject compared to those who don't. Green is the color that's often linked with the nature which could bring the feeling of calmness and safety.

"At the present time, the population of some countries includes a relatively large number of young adults, compared with the number of older people. Do the advantages of this situation outweigh the disadvantages?","There is some notions about a benefit and a drawback of a country having a very large number of young people. despite the immense numbers of youth leads to an unwise society, I agree that it will increase the productivity of the nation's economy.

It is obvious that, the longer human live the more it will gain knowledges from their experience in life, thus the younger people tend to have an immense spirit but lack of experience that can lead them to take unwise decissions. For example, Indonesia and India as the nations with most of its population are youth, has face the several violenced demonstration in the couple of decades mobilized by the youngers. while in Japan with the highest population of elders, the anarchies were rarely to be happened. it implies on a common perception where more elderly people will leads to a wiser society.

The increasing numbers of youth usually called as the demographic bonus, where the number of productive population is higher than the unproductive ones. it means that the unproductives will be supported by the productives both in logistic and safety. For example, Japan was received the demographic bonus in 1930 - 1940, it is immidiately lift up japan as the leading economy in Asia because most of its citizens are in productive phase. it implies on the availability of human resources that can support the backbones of nations economy.

In conclusion, The nation economy will received huge merit from the presence of high youth population in the countries. However, it can leads to several phenomenon of unwise action motorized by the youth. Where possible, the economic wellfare of the youth should become the priority. ",no,no,yes,yes,6
"The proportion of elderly people in some countries, like Japan, is considerably higher while in some other regions, including some Asian and Western countries, young people comprise the highest percentage of the total population.","The proportion of elderly people in some countries, like Japan, is considerably higher while in some other regions, including some Asian and Western countries, young people comprise the highest percentage of the total population. Having a larger proportion of youth is considered to have more advantages for a country, and I think that a country should have more active youths for faster development.

To begin with, the young generation is dynamic, energetic, and can contribute to the job sector which has a huge positive impact on the economic development of the country. They come with fresh ideas and are free from old superstitions and traditional beliefs. It gives them a competitive advantage. The educated young generation is the best resource a country can have, and their contribution to the country is significantly higher than the participation of children and elder people. The contribution of the older people, however, could not be denied and they have already done their part for reforming the country. They have vast experience and wisdom that are vital for decision making. They are often considered a better fit for the decision-making positions.

Moreover, children are the future of a country, and the elderly have already played their roles. On the contrary, the young generation is the active workforce and can lead to the overall growth of the country. They are active citizens in society while children and senior peoples are dependent on others. The young generation can learn things faster and can share ideas, and this is why they are better leaders. The ICT sector, for instance, is full of fresh minds and is globally led by young minds. The ICT sector is considered to be the most prominent sector for the development of a country, especially in this technological era, and it highlights the importance of young and fresh minds over elder people in a country.

To conclude, older people should not be considered a burden for the country, however, the young have more to contribute to society and the country as a whole. This is why it is more beneficial for a country to have an active workforce than dependent senior citizens. ",no,yes,yes,yes,6.5
The prevention of health problems and illness is more important than treatment and medicine.Goverment funding should reflect this.To what extend do you agree,"In the present society, the amount spend by people for their health treatments is extremely high. Out of the half per cent of population in a country is suffering with one disease or the other. There are a plethora of diseases available around as. “Prevention is better than cure” is famous proverb stating the benefit of blocking a disease before it comes. It is always better to avoid these diseases and illness rather than spending huge amount in treatment. Government contain a enormous sector of money for the health of the people, they should divert this funds for avoiding these diseases.

To begin with, the individuals are affecting with many water bone diseases like malaria, dengue, chicken gunia and many more. These only due to bad drainage system facilities in the towns. Mosquitoes are given chances to lay eggs which lead to increase in the number of mosquitoes. These insects are major carriers of certain diseases. If the government provides fund for drainage cleaning, it reduces the number of people who is going to be admitted in government hospitals.

Secondly, polluted water is another major reason for many diseases. During extreme summer season people will suffer with shortage of water in their areas. So they get water from public wells, rivers and so on. This water may not be pure. At this situation government must initiate facilities to purify water. For example, in Germany they water purifier centres working with solar energy which reduces the cost involved.

Adding to this government can introduce public gyms and health fitness centres for common mans by charging an affordable fee. This will help numerous people to do regular exercises without spending much.

As per the health report published by a magazine shows that the money spend by public health department is 75% of its total budget amount. And also it seems to be rising. To avoid this proble, fund should be properly utilised for preventing illness rather than its treatment. There should be departments to check the health conditions of the society. ",no,yes,yes,yes,6
It is generally believed that the Internet is an excellent means of communication but some people suggest that it may not be the best place to find information.,"In a globalized world where everyone shares their own thoughts and opinions about what happens in the environment surrounding them, apparently the Internet has become the only way with which people find information. However, this can be debatable, since there are also other means of communication, such as the news, newspapers, and the local press, to keep us updated about what is occurring in the world.

For this reason, many people think that social networks, such as Facebook, always tell the truth. Nevertheless, sometimes this can lead to believe to fake news. This occurs because people don’t verify their sources: once you find a news, you should not be immediately involved in its content. Instead, you have to do a research whether that news is true or not, by typing its title in a common web browser.

However, I guess a large number of people prefer a website rather than a newspaper to find information is because is a lot faster, cheaper and more comfortable. For example: if someone wants to know what today’s news are, he just have to click it on a smartphone and you have tons of information about what happened in your country today from your home. However, if you want to find the same information in a newspaper, you have to move from your chair, take the car, and buy it every single day in order to keep you updated.

To conclude, I reckon that the Internet has revolutionized our lives and now it is way easier to get access to the news or to cultural and political information. Nonetheless, I also think that when searching for information, we need to be conscious about whether the source is true or not, by doing our own research. ",no,no,yes,yes,6
Some people think that the only way to judge someone's success in business is by the amount of money they make. is this a true indicator of the success of a business and in what other ways could success in a business be measured?,"Most of the people argued that, earning from business is the real parameter for measuring success in the business and other people argued that, it is not only indicator for judging business achievement. This essay will analyse the both views. To earn profit people start their business. Basically, it is considered the main goal. This goal plays a crucial role to the further steps. Todays world, we measure the sucess on the basis of the earning of the business organisation. For instance, the owner of the TESLA company Alon Musk was the richest man in the world. Last week, but the owner of the Amazon company become the richest person now. This measures done by the basis of their income. By earning profits they gained huge reputation. Money has its own significance in this regards.

while, money plays a crucial role for recognising the success of the business. , brand value and positive repuation also needed. Todays competitive and busy world people are earning money by any means. Lot of people take loan for bank and never back the money to the bank. They declared themselves as bankcrupts. Later, those types of business owner becomes one the richest person in that perticular country. For example, In Bangladesh 2007, owner of BEXIMCO company declared himself as bankcrupts, 12 years later he becomes one of the richest person in Bangladesh. This type of business can not be considered as successful business.

Additionally, positive response from customers as well as creating reputation also necessary. This types of business grow with the positive feed back from customers. For example, XIOAMI company started their business with very less marketing strategies. They had faith on their products. Now they are successful by getting good responses from people.

To sum up, money bran value, and positive reputation needed to be considered as successful business. Good business person earn profit as well as reputation also. ",no,no,yes,yes,6
It is irrefutably true that these days most companies are approaching strategies such as sponsoring sports events to increase their sales.,"It is irrefutably true that these days most companies are approaching strategies such as sponsoring sports events to increase their sales. Some people opine that sports sponsorship is a great marketing tool to promote their products; however, others believe that this trend has tremendous drawbacks. I bolster the former opinion and think that this strategy is not only promoting the company primarily but also providing a platform for passionate players.

To begin with, sports sponsorship is considered as a lucrative industry across the globe. It is worth noting that it gives mutual benefits to both parties. While the company gets a golden opportunity to access a more comprehensive number of audience and increase their sales, sports committees get a chance to use that money to develop infrastructure and help the players financially. For example, Hyundai, who was the main sponsor of the last world cup cricket match, invested billions of monies in sponsoring the event and recorded an accelerated rate of sales turnover after the series. On the other hand, the International Cricket Committee used a larger portion of received money to develop cricket in low - income countries.

Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time.This can benefit teenagers and the community as well? To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In today's era, volunter work plays an imperative role in society. Some individuals believe that teenagers should have to do unpaid community work during their free time, which will be beneficial for both juveniles and community. I partly agree with this statement and this essay will discuss the reasons to substantiate it in subsequent paragraphs. To commence with, there are plethora of benefits for teenagers by doing volunter work. First and foremost, by doing unpaid work, teenagers will obtain experience, which would help to youngsters in future to achieve their ambitious easily. For instance, number of people who are success in their life always start work in teenage. Thereafter, they become able to achieve their goals by using that experience. Furthermore, this would be great opportunity for adolescents to learn moral and ethical values during doing community work and they could also become socialize with community because when teenagers would have to do work for community, they will interact with different types of people, which will help to overall development of adolescents. To exemplify, recent survey of Guelph University, Canada found that if children improve their communication skills by interacting with different people, then he will become succesful person in their life. On the other hand, by doing volunter work, the education of teenagers can be adversely influenced due to hectic schedule. In addition, sometimes during work, teenagers could also lose their interest in study as well. Therefore, juveniles should not do community work. To recapitulate, it can be concluded that, although there are chance of worse results of unpaid work by teenagers but most probably juveniles will acquire many benefits with community work.

Crime rate in most countries is often higher in urban areas than in rural areas. why do you think that is? what can be done to reduce crime rate,"It is believed that the number of people committing crime in urban areas is mostly higher than that in rural areas in most countries. While there are various reasons for this problem, some solutions could be taken to reduce the crime rate. The population in cities is increasing dramatically. Therefore, there is fewer job opportunities, accommodation and so on. Because of unemployment and high cost of living in urban areas, people cannot afford even basic necessities such as food and clothing. As a result, these people would turn to crime such as drugs trafficking, robbery or even human trafficking to earn money. The other reason is that the gap between poor and rich people is becoming wider and wider. Social inequalities is increasing as a consequence. Since the poor could not pay the tuition fees for their offsprings to go to school, some of those children would be attracted to using drugs. In short, widening gap between rich and poor also lead to rising criminals. In order to deal with increasing crime rate, government should take strong measures such as punishing offenders severely. Longer sentence could help to deters rising crime. Moreover, government opportunities and local authorities should also create more and more educational opportunities for needy to narrow the rich-poor gap down. Besides, people should give criminals a chance to reintegrate into society after they are released. This will discourage them from committing crime again. ",no,no,yes,no,5
"In some countries, a few people earn extremely high solaries. Some people think that this is good for a country, while others belive that the government should control salaries and limited the amount people can earn.","In many places of the world there are people who like to earn much money and they try to it. However others don’t think like that. That is, they believe that the state should control wages.

Nowadays, it is well konown that good professions require a good salary. Obviously, the reason for this is the development of states and it is that people work on themselves. In other words, highly qualified and talented people should be rewarded with a salary commensurate with their work. Of course, high wages are a sign of a country’s wealth. When the population is rich, so is the government. For instance, high-income people can create businesses and similar jobs to employ other locals. Which in itself will be beneficial both to the people and to the state. I don’t think government should limit vages. because where there are people of the same layer, there will be no development. This situation is also will caus a lot of protests among the people. In my opinion all people should be paid according to their labor.

if we look at world statistics, we can see that the country with the highest salary is the most developed. In turn, changes begin to take place in every area. Higher wages further increase fidelity to employment. In a sense, it also plays a big role in the development of a healthy thinking generation. There is another side to getting a higher salary - the higher the salary, the higher the taxes. One example, the well-known football player Ronaldo earns 31 million EURO and pays 18. 8 million EURO in taxes.

There are millions of people on earth and they are all struggling to survive. It is very difficult to live without good money in an era of rapid development. With that in mind - I don’t think the state should impose restrictions on salaries. And you?",no,yes,yes,yes,6
explanations about why we remember something better than others.,"The professor discusses explanations about why we remember something better than others. She proposes two reasons for it.

First, previous knowledge. In the case of we have previous knowledge about the subject it helps us to remember details easier. The professor provides an example of a classical music concert to illustrate this. Provide a man that is familiar with classical music, for example, he studies classical music, or he listens to lots of classical music. As a result, it's easier for him to recall details about the concert.

Second, unusual characteristics in a subject. When there is an unusual characteristic it's easier for us to remember them. The process provides an example of a big class to illustrate this. After a year we can remember only people that are unusual, tall or immensely smart people.

That’s how the professor explains why we better remember something rather than others. ",Yes,yes,yes,yes,7
"In some countries, owning a home rather than renting one is very important for people. Why might this be the case? Do you think is a positive or negative situation?","Nowadays, Renting a home and owning it is equally popular. In few countries, people think that living in personal home is more important than living in a rented home. This essay will discuss the reasons of owning a home and explain why this situation is a positive for people.

There are two essential reasons of why rented home is not so important. Firstly, Owning a home allows people to build wealth to purchase future homes. As, it becomes investment for lifetime and one can even sell if any unfavorable circumstance arises. For instance, Most of the people in India buy own home for investing. So, Owning home is very important for the purpose of investment and to increase the wealth of a person. Secondly, when you are buying home, one can do exactly what one want to do with it. This means one will have more flexibility to reconstruct or ammend anything which is not comfortable or appealing to a person. Many people like to have a kitchen with more cabinets and dining room in kitchen only. So they easily change anything according to their wish.

In my tenet, buying own home is a positive situation for people. For people who does not have financial problems and can buy a big home without taking any loan, their house is an asset and a positive situation for them. There are many people who decides to live in only one place for lifetime and does not want to migrate to any other country, so for those people renting a home for their whol life can be more expensive than owning a home in that country and creates an overall positive situation.

To conclude, I feel that owning is home is best option than renting a home. This essay discussed some important reasons of purchasing a home it increases positivity for people who buy without loam",no,yes,yes,yes,6
It is quite common for both parents in a family to work. Sometimes this is because they need two salaries to survive whereas other times it is their choice.,"Expenses are increasing day by day for all kind of human requirements like food, accommodation and children education, etc. and living standard is improving due to various technological innovations. So, it has become common for many families to have both parents working. There are two kinds of families having working parents nowadays. Some may choose for having a better life and to make their future financially secured, while another choose because of their financial needs. Recently, from last decade women empowerment has seen a significant improvement. So, Women are sharing equal responsibilities with men in all professions.

I believe that families having both working parents have edge over others in financial perspective. But its impact on children must be recognised first. In families, when parents go to work, children are left at home alone. Some people argue that children become independent and they learn how to manage their selves. In addition, they believe that children who grow up having the support of their relatives in the family make them more social and kind.

On contrary, other believes that both working parents do not give enough attention to children’s development. Thus, children become undisciplined and may go out of hand sometimes. According to them, if one of the parents is earning enough money, then another should concentrate on children’s development. Money is not a serious matter always. Parents should not become too greedy.

There are many examples of both working parents from my friend circle. They are good parents and understand their responsibilities towards their children. So, as a conclusion, I will say it depends on the way of thinking of individuals and the way of interacting with their kids. One should identify own situation and requirements and act accordingly.

"The most beautiful cities People visit modern cities for various purposes, some for just travelling, some for business reasons and so on.","The most beautiful cities

People visit modern cities for various purposes, some for just travelling, some for business reasons and so on. It is controversial issue which city is the most dazzling and fascinating. However, there are some destinations which are special. From my point of view, taste is personal thing and depend on individuals.

First, when someone asked beautiful city you would tell them about well-known cities such as Paris, London or Rome. Each of them has their individual beauty. For example in Rome it is vivid that you can introduce their old culture and architecture. Paris is city for love and romantic. In London, there are a lot of rainy and cozy days. Of course their famous double-decker bus.

On the contrary, I am eager to spread information about exotic places such as Africa, Kenya. Less people consider exotic plases as beautiful. In Africa you can meet leos, elephants, giraffes outside the cages. They know the real taste of freedom. Culture of Africans is stunning for every terrestrial.

To recapitulate, it is complicated task to choose only one or two city. Our world is full of amazing destinations

"Computers today can quickly and accurately translate languages, therefore, it is a waste of time to learn a foreign language. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is argued that it is time consuming to learn a new language because computers recently have been able to translate various languages extremely fast and precisely. However, In my opinion, I totally disagree with this statement as although these kinds of technologies and apps can slightly help us in life, learning a foreign language is really beneficial for boosting communication skills and making your writing more beautiful.

The first reason why learning a new language is not wasting of time is that it is extremely effective and helpful for improving fluency of speaking. This is to say that there are a number of intonations and rhythms which should be learned to enhance speaking skills so it could be possible to speak like a native speaker. Moreover, although fluent speaking is a little bit difficult, numerous techniques such as shadowing technique would simplify the way of speaking by listening to a podcast and imitating the intonation of the native speaker. For example, there are some fabulous videos, such as TED Talks, which are really worth watching and useful for boosting english language because of it's simple language and conversational exchanges between some friends.

Another reason why I do agree with learning a foreign language is that it raises the quality of your writing. This is because there are lots of collocations, idioms, high level vocabularies and grammars which help you to transmit your emotion and concept better in writing. Conversely, digital translators are not as operational as human being language because they always use the simplest sentences and never apply mentioned items. Moreover, using linking words during writing would be essential for making your writing more cohesive and literal. For instance, annually a lot of students can pass the IELTS examination, which is an international examination test system and extremely authentic among numerous universities, with high score in writing skill because they have gained the ability of how to deal with this language.

In conclusion, I consider that although technology has helped us to do some works easier, such as text translation, certainly it can not be alternative for the ability and knowledge of human being as learning foreign language has a lot of positive effects on speaking and writing skills.

Increasing the price of petrol is the best way to solve the growing traffic and pollution problems. To what extent do you agree or disagree with the statement? What other measures do you think might be effective?,"Traffic and pollution take place the most important global problems in recent years. An approach argues that the best solution is to rise the price of petrol to reduce and solve these two important problems. From point the of my view, although expensive price may be an effect on reducing the problems, I do not agree that this is the best way and I think other measures are applied for a permanent solution.

Increasing price to solve traffic and pollution problems is not sustainable and effective for people and governments. In terms of people, high prices cause to damage peoples economical structures because people start to spend more amount of their income for their transportation. Besides, selling of cars decreases and this brings about to depression in the car industry. Therefore, the balance of countries' economies is disrupted. Furthermore, study research which is conducted by the United Nations displays that countries which have the highest petrol price have also higher traffic and pollution problems than other countries which apply low price system.

On the other hand, solving traffic and pollution problems requires different measures. One of the fundamental measures is using recyclable fuel for vehicles. To exemplify, increase of the product and use electric cars ensure to considerably decrease air pollution and carbon emission. The second main measure is developing public transportation systems. If the cities and countries have extensive transportation lines, people do not need their personal vehicles. As a result of this, not only the problem of heavy traffic disappear but also it is earned environmental benefits.

In conclusion, increasing the price of petrol will not offer a stable solution for traffic and pollution, hence other measures should be implemented instead of it.",no,yes,yes,no,5.5
"Some people are afraid to leave the house because of crime. Some believe that more can be done to prevent crimes, while others think there is little that can be done. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Recently, the crime rate has been increased sharply worldwide. Some people believe that measures must be taken to mitigate this trend, while other think that there is nothing can be done to fix it. I personally agree with the former opinion since if the problem is not addressed soon, both societies and individuals will enocunter adverse consequences. In this essay, I will discuss both opinion along with my personal view.

On one hand, the main reason why some feel that a little can be done to eradicate a crime rate is the economic recession; in other words, most of the countries that suffer from a sharp ctime rate are poor countries. These countries do not have proper educational, health, and justice systems; this leads their citiziens to commit crimes only to provide themselves with basic needs. Thus, it is highly likely that imposing any laws will prevent any crime as the reasons behind are is not defined and solved from the first place. According to a study conducted in Cairo university, 80 % of the convinted criminals do crimes again after getting out of prison. This shows that nothing can be done and it is better to stay at home to avoid getting attacked by a criminal.

In other hand, other and me are completely think that there are several ways that can be used to decrease the crimes phenomenon. Firstly, governments can improve the living standards for the whole society by giving subsides to people in need. An effective solution is train and educate prisoners, who committed minor crimes rather than punishing them. For example, Canada is one of the first countries that have converted crimainls to good society memebers. This is why there are a few number of prisons in this prosperous nation.

In conclusion, it is a fact that the other rate is raising rapidly in the world. Nonetheless, I totally believe that are different actions which can be taken to tackle this issue",no,yes,yes,yes,6
Some people believe that having a conversation on a mobile phone in a public or crowded place should be banned. Others feel that we should be able to talk wherever we like. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Numbers of people claim that they feel annoyed by someone who talk loudly by their mobile devices in public or crowded places. It has been an issue of heated debates whether it should be banned, or it is exaggerated step, that violates human rights. In this essay I will discuss both views and state my own position.

Those who support restrictions regarding conversations in crowded places claim that noises can irritate them from important tasks. Since many people are engaged in the activities outside, phone conversation of others can be disturbing. For example, many students in library may get distracted by noises, subsequently they may not able to perform their task with full dedication, which will affect on their grades. It is also may be considered as a disrespect to other people, who wants to be in peace and calm, while they are in a public. Unfortunately, subsequences of it may lead to misunderstandings and frustration.

Meanwhile, opponents of restrictions claim that it is a pure violation of rights of people. This is because phones are beneficial these days, it also can be a lifesaving device, which can solve any emergency cases by one call. For example, pregnant woman can immediately call her family members or 911 in emergency situations, in order to get assistance. Hence, there are cases, where conversations in public places cannot be forbidden, since there is huge risk getting lost of human life and results might be catastrophic.

In conclusion, while there are convincing arguments on whether public telephone conversations should be banned or not, I believe that comfort of other people should not cost a human life. Furthermore, every person should be allowed to communicate with their loved ones as many times as it needed. ",Yes,no,yes,yes,7

"Some people say that the best way to improve public health is by increasing the number of sports facilities. Others, however, say that this would have little effect on public health and that other measures are required. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","Public health improvement solutions are so common in societies. Although some people believe that the quantity of sports centres may increase the awareness of people regarding to healthy life, others have opposite opinion as other solutions need to be implemented. This essay will discuss the enhancement of public health and the possible solutions to increase public attendance.

Firstly, the quantity of leisure activity centres makes them easy to access in terms of distance from inhabitant location. The free time is so valuable for people and they would like to use it as efficient as possible so the accessibility to sports centre in a short time is crucial for busy people. For instance, if I had a chance to spend five minutes to get to the sports centre rather than spending an hour, I would definitely feel more motivated and follow activities regularly so the number of areas which are allocated for sports activities may increase the number of attendance.

On the other hand, qualification or expertness of leisure centres have the importance on public health. While the people may want to flexibility of their body, with the lack of expertness, they may hurt some part of their body and have health issue on their life so the selection of sports centres regarding to their capability have importance on people lives and this should be investigated before registration to a centre.

In conclusion, despite the accessibility of sport centre may seem attractive for doing sport activity, it also brings drawbacks as well. It seems to me that we must register a sport centre which provide us professional support. Otherwise the outcome of activity will be worse than not to do it. ",No,no,yes,yes,6
"It is often said that the government spends too much money on the projects of protecting wildlife, while there are other problems that are more important. To what extent do you agree or disagree","Government has a fixed budget and the allocation of the amount has to be done sensibly. Allocating large amount of money for the protection of wildlife is unnecessary overlooking the other major issues which are or much importance. I considerably disagree with this statement.

Wildlife is an extremely important part of human life, to protect and conserve it for the society and for the future generation is the government’s responsibility. Firstly, conserving wild animals and plants will generate tourism for the country which ultimately leads to higher revenue and economic growth. In India, tourism consists of 30% of total revenue, generated in 2019. However, another point into the consideration is that the future generation is yet to see the wildlife which exist. For example, some species such as dinosaurs and other carnivorous animals have already vanished and some, such as white tigers and lions are on the verge of extinction. Allocation of the considerate amount of money to preserve wildlife is justified.

Education and health care are other more important issues for the government to concern. Learning sector improvement will also raise the employment rate and gradually helps in the growth of the country, the employment rate has increased by 12% as compared to the last year’s statistics. However, another major issue is health care which requires more attention, funding the health care system and proving the latest machines and new medicines is the need of an hour. For instance, Higher rate of cancer’s which also needs different treatments at various levels. Government also needs to take into consideration these aspects of the society.

Exams as A Form of Assessment?,"Nowadays many schools, colleges, and universities assess their students using final examinations. The disadvantage of assessing students by examines is not prospered. In order to, exam brings negative effects to students and the examination does not work on students. On the other hand, the advantages of that help teachers know the capacity of students’ performance.

One of the disadvantages of taking exams as an assessment brings negative effects as causes stress to the students in which prone to exhaustion and illness. to illustrate, when students get unsatisfied results in the exam. A lot of students cannot retain handling this issue for their results. Consequently, a lot of students enter into a depressed state. Furthermore, assessing from exams not considered a real appraisal is because examinations usually test on students’ memory but not their real understandings. For example, some students are meticulous, active, and surpassing in the class but in the exam, they are extremely nervous, thus they cannot answer, they will get low grades. It could also be said that some lazy students who last-minute revision tend to memorize everything on their notes without even trying to understand the principles, and in the end, they get great grades, which is not fair.

Those opposed to this say that teachers will gain more knowledge of their students. To illustrate, the exams help teachers to know more in which the students are weak to improve them more and more and every student have an issue in some subjects and with exams teacher know in which part can he do favors to the students to help them incrementally improving.

In conclusion, take exams as a form of assessment have advantages at given more information about students to their teachers. However, assessing from exams are having disadvantages as can be very stressful and a majority of students usually do worse in normal exams compared to in other forms of assessment. In my opinion, the examination should be replaced with other forms of assessment.

Some experts believe that it is better for children to begin learning a foreign language at primary school rather than secondary school. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?,"As a matter of fact, I believe that the earlier a child starts to begin learning a foreign language the better. Children have a very fresh brain and have the capability to absorb much more information compared with adults and even teenagers.

I can give examples from my own experiences. First of all, I’ve lived abroad during my first ages and started to learn English. Actually, before I learned Turkish, I learned English After seven years living in Saudi Arabia and studying in American Kindergartens and a Primary School, my family decided to return to Turkey. When we moved back to Turkey, I continued my studies at a Turkish Primary School and started to learn Turkish rapidly. Therefore, this showed me how a child could learn a foreign language very quickly.

For the following years, I did not have the opportunity to use my English as frequently as I could when I lived abroad. I only could practice English in my English lessons. However, when I started to work for a global multi-national company years later, I realized that I did not forget my English at all. This also showed me if you learn a language in your childhood, you never forget it.

On the other hand, last year I decided to learn a second foreign language and started to take German lessons. I was attending a course which young pupils were involved. During those lessons I was quite shocked how fast those youngsters understood the lesson and how hard I was struggling.

The advantage of becoming a freelancer is that you can work whenever you want.

The disadvantage of being a freelancer means that your income and your workload are unstable and inconsistent. Distinguishing Between Work and Personal Time means that it can be difficult.

"Some people think students should study the science of food and how to prepare it. Others think that school time should be used in learning important subjects. Discuss both views and give your opinion? Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","It is assumed by some people that it is necessary to gain knowledge about food and also learn its making process. On the other hand students should emphasize the essential academic subjects in the school. However, both view have distinguished logic about the necessary learning, I would like to describe both aspects in a sensible way and establish my own thinking.

On the one hand it can be said that as a perfect human being everyone mus learn every necessary skills. The sxcientific explanation of food items is sound relevant topic to learn. Due to the globalization people are becoming familiar with variety of dishes which have different origin and taste. If students can know the science behind that item and what kinds of benefit and drawbacks of this item, they will be able to explain it in a scietific way. Besides learning food making is one of the major things that help people become a good chef. In other word whenever a student go abroad for higher study he must know cooking and previous knowledge can cooperate him to do it in a perfect way. Todays students will become the future leader of a nation thus they should have distinguish knowledge that can make him a good human being.

Onthe other hand it is also important to spend more time to study essential academic outlines because it will help him to get better career opportunity. Most of the people particularly parents focus the career oriented subjects such asmath, Enlish, physics and so on because their chil will become a scientist or doctor or get huge opportunity in oversease. Its obviously necessary for the sake of overall development. A nation expect an expert, competent, skilled young generation whom can bring changes in the country. Consequently every student should learn their major academic learnings since school period. Moreover, school is the fundamenntal place where a student can get the direction of the rest of life.

In my assumption I would like to promote both learnings because to get a successful life people should equally study every branch of knowledge. For example in western countries, a kid can do everything in a hand not only academic study but also extra activities such as making own food, purchaning grocery items from super shop etc. They are independent enough.

About her appearance, I should say that she is in her late twenties, and she is a happy person who always has a beautiful smiling face.

She has an average build, a fair complexion, and long straight brown hair.

About her special qualities, since she never finds it difficult to be a successful person, she is less likely to fail. She is a very accomplished person with a sizeable number of achievements. Nevertheless, I've never seen that she brags about her successes. So she is humble and modest too.

One of the great personality traits about her that I really look up to is that she never settles for second best. Actually, she tries her best to achieve goals.

Besides owing to her trustworthy and reliable manner, I turn to her when I run into a problem.

Consequently, I've learned a lot from her. I learned how to be positive even in difficult situations, and how to be kind and jolly. ",Yes,yes,yes,no,6
Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.,"Educational system in most countries is becoming easier and easier every year. Students may choose limited number of courses and not study maths or science on advanced level; phones are allowed during the lessons; some countries in the world cancelled homework and so on, and so on. . .

A lot of people, especially young learners, find this pace of learning comforting. Their reflections are based on phrases like “Why would a scientist need dates of all the Civil Wars in USA?

"Some people believe that money is the most important factor for achieving happiness. However, others believe that happiness has nothing to do with money. Agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","There are two main atitudes toward grafting wealth unto cheerfullness. Some people claim that there is a positive correlation between welfare and gladness, while some individuals deny it. I personality believe that money may sometimes make people satisfied, but wellbeing does not rely on being rich. I will support this view with arguments in the following paragraghs.

Let us take a look at first point. It is true that following exciting sports and eating enriched food and learning requires money. Also, we know a life without being meet the basic needs is gloomy. All thing, according the first idea, humans can not feel goodness without having enough money. For illustrait, the empact of poverty on individuals depression was seen in Africa, in which people die and suffer.

The revers of what were said, l do not think that such reasons are sufficient for

reasonable judgment. A group number of researchers are demonstrated that joyfulness is related to high levels of people self-steem. Which means that, you will be merry, If you be interested in yourself rather than money. Indeed pleasence is a personal choice. Take an some rich people with sever illness as an instance, this issue displays that money can not buy happiness, however he/she could decside to be optemestic. The truth that money boosts the levels of material prosperity, yet it can not purchase healthy, self-respect, wellbeing and in one a word happiness.

children should be raised with their friends or by themselves,"Raising a kid is a kind of art nowadays. Some families believe in that children will be more developed, If they spend more time with their friends, being a part of particular groups. For all that, some people do not agree with this idea. They firmly believe that children who play or grow up by themselves are better performing for their further lives.

Firstly, Children, those being in a part of a particular group may be more social. It is crucial for us to improve our productivity or develop new skills such as cognitive skills has been helping us since when we were a kid. Children learn novel ideas or abilities from their parents and can transfer them to their friends while they are spending time.

The secondary altercation is about children who are growing up by themselves. It leads them to help to develop their survival-ability skills. Life is hard and families must prepare their children against it. An individual has to do everything by itself it is not firmly knowledge that we will have friends always. They must know how to endure the obstacles when the time comes to face the reality. When they become an adult, they will go through a lot of things such as loneliness.

In my personal point of view, children those raised alone are more success. However, our lives are determinated by our environment, loneliness keeps away our kids to from some bad habits those tend to such as smoking, drugs and alcohol. Families should pander their kids raise them with their loves and should void them to have a bad friends.

In recent years women have been working in equality with the men not only in foreign countries but in India as well.,"In recent years women have been working in equality with the men not only in foreign countries but in India as well. While there are many benefits to this trend, there are certain drawbacks to be considered. In this essay, I will discuss both the positives and negatives associated with it.

To begin with the merits, a crucial advantage of this phenomenon is women independency. This is because when they would go out to earn, then they might not be dependent upon their family for there desires. For example, many non-working ladies are often seen demanding their partners for their needs, as they lack the funds, while this might not be the case on the other side. Besides this, a female could become a worthy member of a family and gets socialised at the same time. As they tend to go out, meet with new folks, and build fresh links. Due to their working abilities and experience, they are looked upon their advice as well.

Nevertheless, this scenario presents some problems also. For instance, children get deprived of their mother's love, as a consequence to which there could be less affection among the kids for their mom. Considering the depth of this situation it is significant that this could be a lot for a lady to bear. Another major demerit of this system is that females might end up lacking time for themselves. For example, after engaging for 7 hours in their job, they have to reach home to see their family as a result no slot for themselves.

In conclusion, although supporting a family by a girl could be a boon but there are enormous effects which could not be unseen. ",No,yes,yes,yes,6
"Directors of Large organization earn much higher salaries than ordinary employees do. Some people think it is necessary, but others hold that it is unfair. Discuss both views and give your own opinions.","There are always contrasting comments on salary of a Directors in comparison to normal workers in large organization due to the vast difference in their remuneration range.

Large corporate has thousands of employees, and multiple trades of business across multiple geographic locations. Consequently, it is essential to create a portfolio structure headed by directors to focus on the workforce, business priorities to run the organization. A director is responsible for critical roles that includes strategic decision-making, business operation liability, improvement of financial growth of the company. For executing this job role, one requires adequate experience, long term vision to take right decisions for organization's benefit. Hence, it is vital to respect the position by compensating the responsibilities carried out by the director with high salary.

On the other hand, numerous people may think that, ordinary employees perform major tasks, and they require higher compensations. For instance, in a software industry we may consider a technician as a normal worker and their compensations are significantly less compared to the top management. Though they do the hard work at the low level, they do not receive appropriate remuneration to compensate their immense effort. It is understood that, their contribution is vital to operate the core business of enterprise. Failure to offer adequate monetary rewards to the normal workers may impact motivations, and in turn an adverse impact is expected in company's growth.

In my opinion, while creating the salary structure, the company should look at multiple aspects of employees; such as skills required for carrying out the job, academic records, work performance, value addition made to the company and the consistency of their performance. Each of the job role should have its own salary range based on the market trend to respect the job position. Periodic revision of salary scale revision is essential for the benefit and motivation of the employees. Organization should never do discriminations based on the class of the workers or by the job levels. Moreover, equal opportunities should be given to all employees to prove their talent and get rewarded with remuneration for the job position. ",no,no,yes,yes,7
"With the increase in transport and accommodation problems in many cities, some governments are encouraging businesses to move to rural areas. Do you think the advantages of this outweigh its disadvantages? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Due to the rising housing and travel issues, authorities feel that people should start considering the option of living in the countryside. I feel that this proposition holds more cons than pros.

I would like to start my arguments by pointing towards the issues related to popoulation. If the government is convinced that overpopulation is exhausiting the cities and this issue can be easily resolved by steering that population to the rural areas. Then I would say that they are mistaken, because rural areas do not have enough facilities to accomodate the population that the leadership is trying to head to those areas. Moreover, this population from conurbation would not settle for anything less than what they were enjoying in their towns until now. Consequently, even if they would decide to move to the lesser developed rural areas they would head back to the cities soon.

It's also very important to understand that the standard of schooling in these less-developed factions is also not up to the benchmark set in the cosmopolitan areas. A country wouldn't want a big chunk of their population to be educated from sub-standard schooling.

This adjustment also lead to the problems related to the availability of employment opportunities in small towns. Citizens working at high positions in megalopolis would not like to shuffle themselves for the bleak options available in the less opportunate countryside.

Administration of a country may allure the citizens by the fresh air and food available in the rural areas, but they also need to take this fact into account that once a big number of people would move to the rural area, then it would also face the same pollution related problems that the government is facing in the urban areas.

Overall, I think government should put more focus on controlling the population rather than moving them to lesser developed societies.",no,yes,yes,no,5
book reader will decrease in future,"I believe new technologies will obsolete books and reduce book readers in our society, for two specific reasons. First, there is more attractive entertainment for us. For example we can watch a video clip or play video games or spend time on social media instead of reading a book. Second, there are better and more convenient tools for learning new things or study. to be more specific, you can listen to an audiobook or listen to a podcast while you are driving which is more convenient than reading a book.

"Some people believe that tourism does more to create tension between countries, rather than, helping individuals, better understanding agriculture. To what extent do you agree or disagree","Currently, many nations economic totally depends upon the tourism although a number of citizen think that tourists build tension in between countries while some believe that it helps civilians economically as well as it helps to understand various traditions most of my largely agree with the premier statement due to its merits.

Finally, Mod of income is one of the dominant reason why I tend to hold my opinion in the favour of tourists, reason being, when tourist visit some country they spent lot of money on the stuff such as food, hotels, daily needs and many other things, which ultimately increase the income of the folks. To illustrate with an example, according to the newspaper The Globe, 80% Thailand economy is depend upon the number of tourist visit their. Moreover, for attracting more and more tourist towards the country government always build new buildings, tourist attraction spot which attract a plethora of people in the country. At the result country is developing.

Secondly, understanding various tradition is an other main standpoint because while visiting to a nation individuals always hire a tour guide to tell them about the ancient history of that country and it increase the knowledge of tourist regarding the nation along with the tradition of the people who live in that nation. Does if any person know the tradition of some other country then it would create a strong bond between the folk. In addition to that, it also helps people to attract with different individuals.

Paradoxically, tourist does create tension in between Nation on owing to that, sometimes tourist do some illegal activities such as smuggling of drugs along with many others. To examplify a survey was conducted by the police department of Canada and it reveals that 60% tourist stay illegally in their country after their Visa expiring. Whereas, this problem could be handled by stricting the law against that culprit.

To sum up, despite that stress created by tourists which could be tackled by creating strict laws against them yet I believe source of income, understanding different culture along with the development of country are the crucial standpoint why people prefer to have tourist in their Nation.

"In some countries, an increasing number of people are suffering from health problems as a result of eating too much fast food. It is therefore necessary for governments to impose a higher tax on this kind of food.do you agree or disagree?","Some people are struggling with health issues because of eating too much fast food to which people cannot control their selves on buying and eating because of its affordability and convenience. Therefore, the government will impose a higher tax on this kind of food. I agree in this statement because it will help people to have a healthy body.

Nowadays, people are interested in many fast foods. It is because it is easy to make order especially when they are in hurry. They do not waste too much time on cooking. In contrast, they do not know that the food they eat is harmful to their health. With this, putting higher tax to fast food can lessen its consumption because people would be hesitant to buy them when their price is getting higher. This would change their budget. If this will be the case, then, people will cook foods that are cheaper but healthy like vegetables. In this way, everyone will be encouraged to eat nutritious food and not the fast food.

Another impact of increasing the taxes on the fast food is that authorities help people to become more disciplined in waking up early and saving money. Because of the convenience that fast food can offer, people tend to become lazy—waking up so late, hurriedly go to fast food and order meals. Aside from devaluing the time, they are spending too much money on these kinds of food. So, if more tax is put to fast food, then, people would hesitate to spend their money anymore to go-to food like this. Instead, they would prepare their own food. This will help them have more time spend in cooking plus saving more money.

In conclusion, fast food has been a go-to meal to people because of its convenience and affordable price. However, these kinds of food make people become unhealthy and sickly. Putting tax can be a solution to this increasing health problem. If this will be imposed, people will be forced to buy and cook cheap but healthy food like vegetable. They would somehow value more the time and money. People would wake up early and pack their food, instead of their habitual routine of eating fast food. This also helps them save money.

"Some people say that the bicycles are a good, modern means of transportation. Other say riding a bicycle has clear disadvantages. Discuss both view points and give your own opinion.","Bicycle is one of the human-oriented transportation which is serve the purpose of environment conservation. A number of individuals today taking advantage of the environmental and health benefits of using bicycles as a primary mode of transportation, whereas others believe that using this mean the most has own adverse repercussions. I am largely in agreement with this idea that notwithstanding potential safety concerns of this means of transportation, the benefits of riding bicycle far outweigh the risks.

Detractors usually argue that cycling can be dangerous. This realization is based on numerous studies showing the fatality and serious injury rates for accidents involving bicycles are significantly higher than for most other vehicles. Even if a cyclist wears a helmet, the rest of their body not be preserved and bikes cannot withstand well to collisions. Furthermore, there are driving conditions in most major cities, where there might not be bike lanes or cars and motorbikes may not be considerate of cyclists’ right of way. The cyclists themselves cause danger if they are arrogant and try to maintain the same speeds or pass motorised vehicles. Overall, in such situations, riding bike might have fatal consequences.

Nonetheless, the slightly increased risks involved in cycling do not outweigh its environmental and health benefit. Firstly, riding a bicycle, not only does not damage the environment, but also helps it by reducing air pollution. Since bicycles do not burn fossil fuels, this is the main reason many far-sighted, environmentally-conscious cities now encourage biking to work with bike lanes and bike-sharing schemes. Secondly, cycling assists individuals to boost their physical health especially when sedentary lifestyles are becoming increasingly due to advances in consumer technology. Finally, it appears that the possibility of commuting to some places, which are located in a narrow street or in nature such as mountains, are greatly more than other means. Thus, it is more likely to enjoy travelling by bike compared with other ones.

In conclusion, despite the risks of riding a bike especially without bike helmet, nevertheless, there are a sizeable number of merits in using bike such as boosting the air quality and well-being. ",no,no,yes,no,6

Many people are attracted to buy some product that they are not needed. Some people are encouraging to buy products because they think it will help to improve their lives.

For me I agree that some advertising product help to our daily living.

Some of the advertisement product is for the house, which we can you use everyday. Giving promo or discounts to their products will encourage you to buy and it will help you alot. Based on my experience some of the advertisements is when they have a new product that they need to announce it, they will do the strategy of advertising’s it. And then they will show how it will help you to your daily living. One example is the vacuum, instead you will use the bamboo grass to wipe a floor, you’ll going to use the vacuum in just a minute you clean the floor easily. The another example is the computer, it help alot to our daily living specially to our dear students. Technology now is very affordable and very useful to our lives. Bu the help to computer’s we can send message in a minute to our family member who are in other countries or far from you. Unlike before, some of us will used to write a letter on a paper and then we will send it to post office and after a month they can receive the letter. Today’s our life is easier, with the help of advertising of some products we know that it will help and improve our lives.

On the other hand, some of the advertisements is not helpful. Sometimes its not good to used, because most of people are becaming lazy to do some stuffs. And some people, they did not afford to buy the product.

To conclude, advertising product is good for some people which they afford to buy, but to other which they are not afford they will just used the product which they usually used.

First, a steady and reliable source of meat. Domesticated animals can be easily raised and reproduced. The professor provides an example of goats to illustrate this. Goats can be easily organized and controlled by only one person, and every time we need meat, we can kill one of them. Second they bring us different food.

High school and I love that was my first time ever r the same thing I can,"At the present time, an enormous amount of people concerned that government should offer a money to retired senior citizen, however, other people believe that a care taker should provide for themselves. I am completely agree with the second argument of the statement.

Although, various people opine that government should give a financial help for retired employees as money plays a crucial role in in everyone life for instance if a person want respect, status and care they need a cash to utilize these basic necessities in their life. Secondly, government should take requisite steps such as it is mandatory to give a pension to the retired senior citizens so that they can live their life with ease without facing any financial crisis in the future. Lastly, government should make important changes in their Constitution for the benefits of retired employee by providing them all the basic facilities without taking any single penny from them.

However, I believe that government should provide an individual for the care of elder citizens because money is a type of source through which we can fulfill our basic necessities for example food, shelter and cloth but they can not share their problems, feelings and emotions with the money so they need a care taker which take care of them. Last but not the least, never feel lonely or depressed if an individual is provided to the senior citizens they never think that nobody is here to talk and listen their problems.

One-third of the masses state that it was only benefit for the wealthy people where is difficult people do not get any advantage from it. This essay will highlight my disagree that why I digree with the notion.

Air travel qives an enourmous benefits to both classes of people rich and poor. To begin with, domestic flight are cheaper as compared to past which opens a gate for middle class people to travel the world without worries at a flare rate. To exemplify, goa would cost 5000 INR by road or flight tickits cost people to 3500 INR per person. because of that people often travel by plane it not only saves the money but also offer a good service in the plane along with the various snacks and hot beverages.

Moreover, other small businesses which are associated with air transport like a travel agency taxes, auto also get a advantage from it. For instance, every year individual comute to other places in nation for different purposes like a business, travel or holidays. As a result taxis and buses outside the airports earn excessive amount of money during vacation. Besides this, it provides high employment. Hence, many people can earn their daily breads.

"High job demands, stress and sense of commitment are among the main reasons people go to work when they are ill. This way they accomplish important tasks, but may infect others or get some serious health problems themselves. In your opinion should people go to work if they are sick? Support your point of view with relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.","In this competitive world, a good job always requires a full commitment from the employee. In a way to show their loyalty towards their work and earn promotion, employees devote most of the time for work, which helps them in completing their tasks but they usually fail to maintain work life balance which then affects their health. In order to survive in the organisation they continue going to work while suffering from health issues and serious infection, which in my opinion is a wrongdoing as they put themselves and other employees in danger. People must consider their health and other's well-being on priority before taking such a risky step going for work during illness.

In recent years, the companies have raised the bar in their working standards. Nowadays, you won't be appreciated for achieving 100 % of your target but you will be pushed to stretch it to 200% achievement. In these types of organizational culture, you have to be proactive to complete those workloads. With this you will be able to achieve your target but this kind of approach is very stressful on mind and body. You should be careful towards your health and others well being too as a sick person can easily make others sick. So it is not the right thing to go to work when you are not fit and healthy.

Every business requires the attention and concentration of every member of the company, but it can be delayed when employee's health is at stake. We must consider our mental and physical wellbeing before working. A fresh mind and relaxed body will help you to focus more on completing your task efficiently in a given time than a stressful mind and exhausted body. For example: Speaking of organizational culture, currently some companies have followed 'Work from Home' work culture so that their employees should maintain work life balance. Recently, A survey by UK Times has shown that people working from home are mentally and physically healthier than regular office workers.

To conclude, Every work is important and the key to become successful goes through mind and body. Health is more essential than work, you will only be productive when you are Healthy. ",no,yes,yes,yes,6

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. Write at least 250 words.,"Entertainment Industry has grown significantly over the last few decades. With the advancement in technology the film industry has developed exponentially, with that the production of a movie requires a huge amount of money and some film companies allocate a massive budget for a movie production. In my opinion spending a large amount of money in making a movie does not give the guarantee that it will hit the Box Office whereas a good story and acting can make a movie successful.

Production of a movie involves Talented Actors, costumes, technical team & etc which indeed are expensive. Millions of dollars are spent on shooting at exoctic location, which includes transportation and accommodation of the whole crew. For a director, to make a decorative and breathtaking movie, special and colourful effects are used which requisite latest and updated technology. This all becomes worthless when a movie does not steal the heart of the viewers which causes misfortune to producers and sponsors. For example: The Movie 'John Carter' a production of Disney worth 300 million dollar had faced massive loss on the very first day after releasing.

Firstly, The story line contributes to the success of a movie and always plays a vital role to attract the audience. Secondly, Good acting also contributes to making a good movie, choosing a wise and real actor can make a difference. Third, A right direction to a story line can attract viewers' hearts and it will help to send a message to society. For instance: Speaking of Story line, Documentaries on real life are much loved by the viewers as they teach a good lesson to the audience.

What can governments do to help reduce the amount of rubbish produced? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. You should write at least 250 words.,"With growing population and demand it is no surprise that the level of waste we are producing is increasing. In this essay, I will explain why this happening and how the production and we as individuals can help tackle this issue.

With the growing fast-paced lives, individuals have gotten accustomed to “one time use” items. The most common waste produced by this is plastic. From shopping bags to cling wraps and take outs the amount of plastic we consume is massive. A major contributor to this is also coffee shops where the cups and straws are made of plastic. To tackle this, few governments around the world such as Thailand and India decided to put a complete ban on plastic. Due to this, people started carrying their own reusable grocery bags or taking their own reusable cups to coffee shops.

Another reason we produce waste is due to the lack of awareness. People are not aware of how much waste is being produce by them. To tackle this, governments can hold beach clean-up initiatives to bring light to this matter. Events like these end up leaving a big impact on an individual.

Furthermore, sustainable living should be encouraged. Encouraging people to adopt a more sustainable lifestyle can help reduce waste. Waste jars have become a recent trend amongst millennials. Collecting the rubbish produced in their daily lives a small jar and acknowledging the waste produced at the end of the week, has helped millennials reduce their rubbish.

To conclude, sustainable living is one of the big ways we as a society and help reduce waste. The government too can play a major role in how much waste is being produced from an individual by simply creating more awareness and initiatives. ",Yes,yes,yes,no,6
Finding job satisfaction is considered to be a luxury in many developing countries. Why do you think that? Do you think job satisfaction is important?,"To find a dream job is a great happiness for the people living in Third World countries. One of the reasons can be considered a lack of proper education. It is obvious that having satisfactory job is crucial both for employers and for employees.

It is believed that in countries with lower economy level, which are considered as developing countries job-salary ratio is far from being satisfactory. Firstly, the absence of job satisfaction in those countries is a consequence of offers in job markets suggesting vacancies with too much low salaries, but with huge quantity of requirements and responsibilities. Another aspect that sheds light on (the cause of) the problem is obviously missing educational background needed for high/higher positions. For example, in African countries hotel housekeepers earn as low as maximum $100 monthly compared to similar jobs in US or EU countries, where the same job with the same duties is awarded four or five times more.

In my opinion job satisfaction plays extremely important and vital role and has two sides of the coin. On one hand if you do a job you don’t love it affects on the quality of the work and on working relations between an/the employer and employee. On the other hand the more you love the better you do your job duties at work, which is for sure will be praised by management with its possible bonuses in perspective As an example I would like to bring the fact of getting bonuses for two time per one year in gratitude of the way I do may job with pleasure.

In fact, people need time to develop their skills and deal with probable errors and mistake they may make. Consequently, as people live longer in a foreign region they improve and prosper and even in some cases they surpass native speakers.

On the other hand, in light of a plethora of apllications and communicative technologies, it's supremely easy to deal with everyday matters even in a foreign country. It is even possible to translate merely by gesticulations into your preferred language. As a result, foreign language limitations are rarely depriving people of establishing communications. However, it should be noticed that a language is not only a means of spoken or written connections. On contrast, it resembles beliefs and is a delegation from culture of a society. Thus, social relations may be a bit problematic.

As conclusion, spending time in a foreign country will gradually help people to alleviate problems and overcome them eventually. Furthermore, majority of these problems could fade into oblivion by using modern communication technologies.",no,yes,yes,no,5
Some people think certain prisoners should be made to do unpaid community work instead of being put behind the bars. To what extent do you agree?,"Crime is unquestionably prevailing in our society. Prisoners are punished hard to commit a crime. However, few people believe that defaulters should be involved in unpaid community services despite locking them in jails. I partially accord to this viewpoint and provide reasons for holding this opinion.

To commence with, sometimes people do crimes due to unfavorable circumstances but get caught and face severe punishments. I reckon that it is cruel. Judges should enquire about the reasons for committing. They should be admitted to community services as it will help them to improve the mistakes. For instance, a person who do small theft only once just to satisfy his/her hunger. Instead of putting in prison, jury must involve him/her in some selfless society services or give an opportunity to improve deeds. Furthermore, I think services like taking care of old people or cleaning up public buildings can actually benefit a criminal to get change.

On the contrary, it is believed that when an individual is forgiven once, there is a possibility that he/she would do it again. So hard punishments will teach them a lesson. We cannot forgive a drug smuggler and a gangster who keep on repeating the crimes rather they should be sent to prisons. Who knows if their mind set change or not after getting involved in community works. Therefore, overlooking such deeds that could harm someone is not right.

To sum, I think community services are helpful in certain cases only. Government should introduce ways that could help wrongdoers to ameliorate their mistakes. ",no,yes,yes,yes,7
Human brings do not need to eat meat in order to maintain good health because they can get all their food from meatless products and meatless substanses. A vegeterial diet is as healthy as a dieat containing meat. Argue for or against the opinion.,"It is well-known that health is depends on our food, nowadays, mankinds follow the vegiterial diet for maintain good health. Because, it contains all the substanses which is avaliable in meat. I completely accord with this notation and it us delineate in further paragraphs.

First of all, meatless food is safe to have in diet, it does not contain any harmful virus. On the other hand, having a diet which contains meat, sometimes, not only, spread illness but also, it infect people with some serious viruses. For instance, recently, in China, bird-flu virus spread widly which is born from meat of birds, many of people who infected was died. Therefore, it is safe to follow vegiterial diet regularly.

Secondly, vegitables contain lots of vitamins including substanses which meat have. Moreover, nowadays, there are so many vegiterial dishes avaliable which taste as like meat. To exemplify, in kerla(india), there is one dish avaliable which is called as 'biriyani'. It is mainly a non-vegetarian dish but they also provide it for vagan people without meat and it is seems to be there are no any difference in the taste of both dishes. However, meat contains more protein as compared to the meatless product but it is negligible. Because, vegitables contain enough protein to makes human healthy. So, being a vagan is not a big deal for someone who eat is only for taste.

To conclude, meatless goods and items have been good for ate because it contains all the vitamins for healthy lifestyle. ",no,no,yes,yes,6
Social media create negative impact on society,"Social media have 3. 6 billion users, and this number is still increasing dues to availability in various languages and allowing users to connect with friends or people around the world. Nowadays, the importance of social media in communication can be seen through society's communication especially in communicating with each other, as well as share and obtain information. Some experts claim that social media enables the dissemination of unreliable information that can reduce the effectiveness of programs, campaigns, and initiatives aimed at the health awareness and well-being of society. However, social media is the best platform to share the latest information and news on public health, other than that; it also can increase a person’s quality of life by having a strong network.

Opposing views claim that social media enables the spread of unreliable and false information. It is because, the applications like Facebook, WhatsApp Messenger, Twitter, and others allow its users to send and sharing messages easily without any hindrance. However, social media also allows for quick and easy dissemination of public health and safety information from reputable sources. Indeed, it helps librarians to disseminate complete and accurate Covid-19 information to society. The information that has been disseminated is consists of information on what is the virus, how the virus is spreading, and how to prevent the virus as suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO). According to Chukwuyere et al. (2020), to ensure that the information to be conveyed to society is accurate and up to date, the WHO has established close cooperation with social media organizations. Therefore, librarians should use the advantages of using social media platforms to share any information with society.

Another claim made by the opposition that as widely known the use of social media can detrimental to well-being. Excessive use of social media can lead to addiction and in turn, can damage one's personality and mind. On the other hand, a person's quality of life can be improved by having a strong social network such as stay connected with friends, family, colleagues can make a person's life more meaningful. Most importantly, it helps teenagers build a better personality because it can often give teenagers a unique online environment to communicate with friends while being able to get the latest information. In fact, social media has the benefit to provide valuable opportunities for teenagers to develop skills. Ni et al. (2019) reported that the usage of online social media has a positive impact on a person’s life, especially in improving stability and self-identity formation.

In conclusion, the latest news on public health information can be shared safely through social media which can be society's important reference, and other than that; having strong networking in social media that connected with family members and friends can improve a person’s quality of life. With the convenience and availability of social media, now the information can be shared with society especially during this pandemic Covid-19, and the relationships established on social media can improve a person's quality of life for a better life. Some people say that social media are used by irresponsible parties to spread fake news, however; it is also the best platform for disseminating information to society especially in sharing public health information. To overcome this problem, the dissemination of public health information on social media must be done only through WHO-recognized social media to guarantee that there is no fake information shared to society.

"In many countries, the crime level is increasing, and crimes are becoming more violent. What is the reason and what can be done about it?","It is irrefutable that crime rate is elevating. As compared to past few decades, nowadays, crimes have become more violent across the globe. Unemployment and ease of buying weapons, seems to be two prominent reasons; however, increasing job opportunities and strict laws can help in eradicating the aforementioned causes.

It is evident that unemployment and inflation are on the rise. Majority of criminals belongs to poverty-driven households or are illiterate, due to which, employers are reluctant to employ them as employers also have many literate candidates for any-position of job. For example, for a vacancy of driver, people who have completed their tertiary education will apply along with illiterate, so clearly, employers prefer educated drivers. Also, due to rise in price, uneducated people are forced to perform crimes for feeding themselves and their families.

Besides, rise in crime figures, now they are of more violent nature. The significant cause of this is easy availability of illegal weapons. There are several places in most of the countries where supply of illegal weapons, mostly guns, happen. A recent survey from University of Manford Berlin suggested that one in every three crimes is done using a weapon.

However, these issues can be resolved by increasing employment for illiterates and enforcing a complete ban on illegal weapon markets. First of all, by creating new vacancies specifically for un-educated people can help them earn a living without indulging in crimes. For instance, launching some criteria for jobs where uneducated or poverty-stricken people will be employed only. Then, enforcing a complete ban and sealing illegal-weapon markets can help in lowering the violent crimes.

In conclusion, unemployment, inflation and ease of procuring a weapon illegally have caused crimes rate to increase, most of which are violent in nature but creating job vacancies which targets uneducated people and banning illegal weapon markets can help in improving the situation. ",no,no,yes,yes,6
"In Spite Of The Advances Made In Agriculture, Many People Still Go Hungry","in spite of the fact that yield and farming improvement in this century but still a lot of people around the still go hungry, there are a lot of reason for this issue, for example society, economical and climate change behind this distributing phenomenonon one hand, famine or food scarcity are cause of the poor, poor people weather grew own food but they are stiil hungray, rech people ensure that they have enough food in their plates but unfortunately poor people have lack of purchasing power because of increasing the price of the food they can not have their fill. the change in the climate is another reason for famine specially drastic drought for example in some country which do not have a rainng for years and it is cause of the famine because of poor people do not have any farm to grew their food and another rich country that have concesstional rate of water and resource for political reason that are beyond them do not share resource of water with them on other hand rich country that have reasonable power to product our food and have surplus crope thaey should be show generose to prevent hungray in the world and also international organisation should be ensure that nation share food between the country that needed to helpin conclusion with product alot of food in over the world people are still hungray and this proplem do not slove until world have a inequitabe distribution between the peoploe all around the world",no,no,yes,no,5
It is true that a large number of people throughout the world suffer from hunger even though the agricultural sector has seen many technological developments.,"It is true that a large number of people throughout the world suffer from hunger even though the agricultural sector has seen many technological developments. There are several reasons for this and the lack of resources and adverse weather conditions are the most important among them. However, there are some measures that can be implemented to tackle this problem.

One of the significant reasons for why people do not have enough food supplies is unevenly distributed resources. In other words, it is known that most people who suffer from hunger are from underdeveloped countries where they have no financial support to conduct researches in farming. Moreover, climate change and geographical differences aggravate this problem. For instance, adequate rain, sunshine and nourished soil are the main requirements for growing crops but they barely exist in some countries in Africa. On the other hand, even though some country has a rich harvest of crops, it is likely to be destroyed by flooding or other natural disasters which might be caused by climate change.

There are many solutions that can be implemented / taken to overcome this trend. Firstly, developed countries can aid poor countries by sharing their technology and financial resources so that those countries can conduct research to find solutions to tackle the famine. Consequently, super seeds and plants can be invented which could stand against undesirable natural conditions even if they are not blessed with best weather conditions. Finally, it is essential to tackle climate change with immediate effect. Otherwise, it will impact the whole world in a negative way.

In conclusion, it is true that a significant number of people in the world suffer from famine even though many farming advancements are currently in use. This can be overcome by providing the knowledge and financial aids for people who need it the most. ",no,yes,yes,yes,6
"While some people consider global warming to be the most pressing environmental problem which we have at the moment, others believe that deforestation has a more devastating impact on our world","The environmental problems have increased sharply as we saw nowadays. Some people think that global warming is the most devastating impact on our planet. Although other individuals hold the view that cutting down trees is a more destructive issue than global warming. This essay will discuss, why these both problems are harmful for mankind.

On the other hand, global warming is the most responsible for soaring the temperature. Firstly, ozone Layer is depleting day by day due to the global warming. The radiations of the sun is a reaching on the earth directly and give its contribution to climate changing. Secondly, ice bags are melting substantially than before as soon as the aquatic life is in endangered because sea level has raised more. The natural disasters are being grown like a cyclone, hurricane and flood.

On the other hand, some population thinks that deforestation is a bigger threat than global warming because it has also more harmful impacts than soaring temperature. Firstly, the air quality is polluting with the deforestation. Climate has changed and many new diseases are arriving. Secondly the capacity of carbon dioxide can be increased because trees releases oxygen. Furthermore, the ruthless cutting of trees for wood has resulted in an immense shortage of Woodlands. Wildlife is being destroyed. Birds also migrate caused by it. Finally, deforestation is also causing also cause of natural disasters.

In conclusion, these both problems, global warming and deforestation are Finally disastrous. Both have resulted in soaring the temperature and climate change across the world. Creating awareness is the most fruitful way of a tackling with these problems that occur with global warming and deforestation. ",no,yes,yes,no,5.5
"Some people believe that global warming is the most challenging environmental issue that we have nowadays; however, others think deforestation has more destructive effects on earth.","Some people believe that global warming is the most challenging environmental issue that we have nowadays; however, others think deforestation has more destructive effects on earth. This essay will discuss why global warming and deforestation are both harmful for the environment.

On the one hand, global warming has caused a drastic rise in temperature all over the world. It is mainly because of the high / higher amounts of radiation reaching the earth due to the depletion of the ozone layer which is caused by the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon -dioxide and chlorofluro carbon. Because of such climatic changes, sea levels are bound to rise. For example, an article published by The Times in 2018 reported icebergs in Antarctica were melting at a higher rate than usual. If, this scenario continues increasing sea levels can cause an entire region to disappear or to be submerged. Moreover, the radiation effects can cause dreadful diseases affecting the skin and eyes.

On the other hand, the cutting down of trees on a large scale will affect the quality of air. Trees absorb carbon dioxide which emanates from the burning of fossil fuels and releases oxygen. Thus deforestation can result in high carbon dioxide levels and low oxygen levels which cause damaging effects on the environment. The high CO2 levels can actually contribute to global warming as well. Generally speaking, the effects of deforestation are usually limited to the area that has lost the forest cover. But global warming is a phenomenon which affects the living beings all over the world. If this issue is unresolved catastrophic events such as tsunamis and hurricanes can arise frequently and also make human beings vulnerable to deadly diseases.

In conclusion, deforestation and global warming are both harmful for the environment. While the effects of deforestation are limited to a particular geographical area, global warming has an impact on the whole planet. However, it is hard to say which is the worst because one thing leads to the other. ",no,yes,yes,yes,6.5
Holding international games such as the olympic games is an exiting event.some people think it has positive effects while others argues it is a waste of money. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.,"As we all are part of this modern world, peoples of this era are so curious about their (physical structure) and health. One of the way to achieve desired physicality and health is sports. To motivate people governments are now organizing international games for the same some group of people think that it is waste of money and time. In contrast some also thinks that it is a good experiment. However, according to my view, i agree with the peoples who claims that it is good to have international games like Olympic in our country.

Firstly, most youngsters have addiction of phonesand digital gadgets nowadays so they are not that much concern about their health, so to improve this, governments are holding international games like olympic. Moreover by watching that youth can motivate them selves to do the same for their conutry and this way they can also improvise their health as well as they might know their hidden abilities and can perform well in that particular field. As an epitome, China organised internatinal games so the youth of china motivated them selves to do the same for their country and had practised for the same so by doing that they had improvised their health. Hence, having such games in our country will improvise country's economy and the youth of the country express their hidden ability and enhance their strength as well.

On the contrary, some peoples are addicted towards educational activities only so they thought that having such events in our country draw the attention of sweet sixteens. Hence they might not concentrate on their study. Moreover they thought that it is not possible for the common peoples to represent them selves or their nations in such events so they simply avoid it by saying that it is only the waste of money but when they knew that most of the sports person who represented their country globally are from common families only. So, now the scenario has been changed and most of the people are encouraging their pupils to do something for their nation so for the same international games like Olympic is one of the biggest platform.

To my belief, Having such games motivates people to do something for their own nation globally and they canaware about their talent. However, having such events will increase the economy of the country because all the supports of the players from all around the world will come to encourage and cheer them. Hence having such international events has more profits than its drawbacks.

In closing, i believe that though the technology has diverted the mind of peoples into gadgets but still by organizing such global level events can make a huge different. ",no,no,yes,no,5
"Some people think that the best way to reduce crime is to give longer prison sentences. Others, however, believe there are better alternative ways of reducing crime. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Some would argue that long-term penalizing is necessary to lessen offense ratio while others say that there are some alternative methods to decrease wrongdoings. Although strengthening punishment time is a mechanism to bring down crime proportions, I believe that lessening down crimes by using diverse methods, other than this, can be more fruitful.

On the one hand, numerous people think that the criminal should be in jail for a longer period, so this will bring fear to a person’s mind. In other words, if a person thinks about crime, he already knows that punishment is going to be too long; he will not do any criminal activity. For example, in some countries to a punishment for a crime is a life-time by knowing this anyone can think twice before involving in a part of a crime. However, there are some better ways too to resolve this issue.

On the other hand, I believe that there are some other ways too to reduce criminals, for example, by educating and increasing employment opportunities. By education, they can get good jobs, and by this, they remain busy in their work. Moreover, they can set goals for their future, so hardly anyone can think about avail any illegal means to satisfy themselves. For instance, education is free in many developed nations, and there are many business opportunities, so most of the people get jobs after their education; that’s why, those countries are counted in the list of peaceful countries. Therefore, I believe that this is better option.

In conclusion, despite the validity of long-time punishments, people can become admirable citizens after getting an education and career for life. ",Yes,yes,yes,yes,7
The urban population around the world is increasing at an astonishing rate and this trend has put a strain on social resources.,"The urban population around the world is increasing at an astonishing rate and this trend has put a strain on social resources. Some people suggest that public parks in cities should be converted to business or residential areas to meet the growing need for land. I completely disagree with this point of view.

Green areas in cities play an important role in maintaining people’s health. To begin with, trees and other plants in public parks can absorb carbon dioxide and other chemicals in the air and this helps to provide better air quality for everyone living / everyone who lives in the city. This improvement can be crucial for those people who are suffering from breathing disorders because of the deteriorating air pollution. Another reason to maintain public parks is that they make a good place for people to exercise and stay fit. Regular exercise helps people build a stronger body, boost their immune system and thus protect them from catching illness.

Moreover, gardens and parks can make cities more visually appealing. If our cities were only filled with skyscrapers, residential areas and business districts, our lives would be dull and bored; whereas the trees and flowers can make our lives more colorful and bring people closer to the nature.

Finally, I would argue that building residential apartments and business centers is not a real option to address the issues brought by urban expansion. In my opinion, a better solution is that the governments should start to build more satellite centers outside already crowded downtown areas. This would not only provide more employment opportunities in suburban areas and boost economic growth but also relieve the air pollution and traffic problems in cities.

To conclude, I strongly believe that public parks in the cities should be reserved as it is beneficial to both citizens and civic landscape. To deal with the growing needs for land use, governments should take other measures such building more suburb centers. ",Yes,yes,yes,no,6
Global warming is one of the biggest threats to our environment. What causes global warming? What solutions are there for this problem?,"It is true that global warming is one of the most pressing problems for many nations because it poses a serious threat to our environment. In this essay, I will outline some primary causes of this problem and suggest several possible solutions.

The predominant factors resulting in the warming of the earth are the emissions of CO2 and deforestation. CO2, which damages the ozone layer, comes from several sources, but the most problematic are those coming from the burning of fossil fuels from power plants. This releases thousands of tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere every year. Another cause of these emissions is the burning of gasoline for transportation, which continues to grow because of our demand for cars and also our increasing worldwide consumption, resulting in an escalating need to transport goods. Also, forests store large amounts of carbon, so deforestation is causing larger amounts of CO2 to remain in the atmosphere.

Nevertheless, there are potential ways to solve these problems, or at least reduce the effects. Firstly, governments need to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and promote alternatives. Plant-derived plastics, biodiesel, wind power and solar power are all things that are a step in the right direction, but governments need to enforce the limits on CO2 emissions for the polluting industries in their countries for these to be effective. Also, individuals can play a part by making lifestyle changes. People should try to buy cars with the best fuel economy, and only use their car when really necessary. They can also switch to energy companies that use renewable energy rather than fossil fuels. Finally, small things like buying energy efficient light bulbs, turning off electricity in the house, and planting trees in the garden can help.

To conclude, although global warming is a serious issue, there are steps that governments and individuals can take to reduce its effects. If we are to save our planet, it is important that this is treated as a priority for all concerned.",Yes,no,yes,no,6
"On vehicle-free day, private cars, trucks and motorcycles are banned in the city centre while the public transport is permitted such as bicycle, buses and taxis. Do the benefits of vehicle- day outweigh the disadvantages?","Undoubtedly, we all are dwelling into modern report, which has a list of great changes in majority of field, specially in vehicles. Owing to this fact, on the vehicle free day, the public transport is permitted by the government and in the city centre the private transports are banned. Although, there are some pros of it, cons cannot be neglected.

On the other hand, there are some benefits of it, first and foremost, alleviate the traffic jams and pollution. In simple words, if the government should do not allowed the private vehicles and permit only public vehicles, then the chances of traffic jams and air-pollution accompanying solution will reduce. For instance, if a person using his private car or motorcycle to commute. Later on, when he enters the city centre there will be more vehicles before him. After that, he will blow horn which creates noise pollution and the smoke which releases from those vehicles will mix in air and when a person inhale an oxygen then that harmful smoke enters in his body and heart and his body from inside and traffic jams will be there.

On the other hand, there are also some drawbacks, people face obstacles in their daily routine. To be justified, Everyone has their own vehicles and they have to go to for a work as they are busy in their hectic schedule and they have to go to for a work to eke out bread and butter for themselves and for their family as well. Apart from it, there is a particular time of public vehicles and we have to reach at a time at the bus stop to get a bus. If an individual got late for his work, he can lost his job and then he face a plethora of hinders while searching for a job. As we know, it is not an easy to survive in this high-tech era.

To convince customers and help companies increase profits and success. However, other people believe that their functions do not affected them anymore. This essay will discuss both point of views and demonstrate my argument.

On the one hand, many companies invested a huge money to advertising because this is a source of earning. So, they created the advertisement not only in the shopping center and they are expanding to the internet which is give the customers more informations and persuade them to buy. For example, when you are surfing the internet, you will spot a lot of advertising and mag click on that to purchase if you interested.

On the other hand, the advertisement will appear all the time when you access to the social media. Therefore, it is accidentally bother you and bring to you the feeling of uncomfortable. Last but not least, advertisement also stimulates the people buy some kind of things that we do not really need and wasted a lot of money. For instance, I had 10 hoodies already but I still buy one more when I see the clothes advertising on the website.

To sum up, while there are some benefits of the advertisement, I still agree with those who think that advertisement does not leave the long-term impression and also it is really common. ",No,yes,yes,yes,6

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Playing Games and watching them became an important Hobby for everyone these days. It is argued that commencing global sports in one's country has lots of benefits. While, others argue that it has adverse affects. Here, I will discuss both views and then my opion towards this topic.

Firstly, hosting International games like Cricket, Football, Tennis helps to get renowed worldy. This, Improves country's economy and also promotes cultural heritage to many people all over the world. Many Foriegners come to watch live matches and this helps the tourism even. For instance, If they have lesiure they spend time to look after our tourist hubs and many sponsors provide better oppourtunities because, country being ambassdor for conducting the sports meet. Therefore, taking chance in arranging those matches has great impact on nations welfare and develpoment.

Secondly, It is better to use such resources for growth and improvement. There are many developed nations which are having better infrastructue, and, they are also economically strong, It is better if they look after these events and, take responsibilities as sponsors for conducting such tournaments. For example, under-developed countries can utilize the amount of money that spend in these events on, Country's basic needs and facilities like Roads, Railways, Harbours, Drainage. Even, they can use this money of primary education which is essential and helps society for its growth. Hence, by investing money on making necessary improvements will help to be one among the developed countries and, later be in position to conduct the amusements in there country.

Discuss both views and give your opinion,"Few individual claims that working hard makes one become financially successful whilst others argues that there are othe factors responsible for this. This essay will discuss both view point and considers the first view as a determinant for financial breakthrough.

On one hand, people who work hard have the tendency of having more wealth. Putting more efforts on ones job enables them acquire more knowledge and skills needed to attain success. This also also gives people the financial privilege in other to be able to afford the things of life. In my opinion more people will achieve more in life from working hard to make a living. For example, Mark zuckerberg founder of Facebook developed the app at a very young age, he achieved after several failed attempts, his resilience and determination made his dream come to pass and today he is recognized as one of the richest man in the world.

On the other hand, some people opine that financial stability doesn't comes from hard work alone. Another factor is those who inherit this wealth from their family. However, a person who is born into wealth ordinarily would be more successful even without getting a paying job. For instance. Prince Edward born into the family of Queen Elizabeth of England has never worked a day in his life but because of the wealth he is inherited from his family lineage he has attained more financial success than the latter.

Under British and Australian laws a jury in a criminal case has no access to information about the defendant’s past criminal record. This protects the person who is being accused of the crime. Some lawyers have suggested that this practice should be changed and that a jury should be given all the past facts before they reach their decision about the case. Do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays in Australia and Britain, a law was passed that a judge has no information of the accused previous criminal history. Some legal practitioners claims that this custom should be abolished and the jury should be given an insight to the suspect past history before they make their decision. I completely agree with the view point that says the judges should be given an opportunity to know about the accused previous crimes as this will give them knowledge on how to pass their verdict. This Essay will elaborate further points.

On one hand, disclosing a criminal past records to the jury would enable them to be able to give their final verdict. Moreover, if a judge gain full access and information on a case he/she would be able to know what this individual is capable of doing. in addition, it also gives the jury more insight on the behavioral pattern of the suspect and make them find more evidence that links the crime to the suspect. For example, in 2004, an American judge was rewarded by the victim’s family with flowers and post cards for his spectacle role in the case, where they made a comment that lead to the accused full confession of the crime.

On the other hand, the law of Britain and Australia frowns at this and this is second to the fact they feel the judge might give a biased judgment as a result of having full knowledge of the criminal offense in the past. However, statistics shows that people who commit a crime feels more secure when they know their case will be fair and free without being threatened by whatever happened in the past life.

In conclusion, while the Australian and British government pass a law that the past records of suspects be withhold from judges some legal officers believes that withholding this information might lead to a non- biased judgement.",No,no,yes,yes,6
Both governments and individuals are spending vast amounts of money protecting animals and their habitat. This money could be better spent dealing with fundamental issues in society such as poverty and health care. To what extent do you agree?,"It is often observed that a hefty amount of resources is deployed on protecting animals and their habitats by both states and people. It is argued that such resources could be better spent in tackling other basic problems in society namely poverty and health care. I support this view that instead of allocating resources extensively on preserving animals and their natural environment, it is more sensible to address pressing issues of the society.

Numerous countries around the world are facing an enormous number of problems. One of these problems is poverty. According to the UN report, more than half of the people in the world are living below the poverty line. This means that either they have no-access or limited access to food, water, clothes, or shelter. In such a miserable situation, it seems illogical and insensible that the governments and the people who are better off spend their money on protecting animals and their habitat, while the poor are disenfranchised of basic life necessities. This behavior creates not only depression and hopelessness in the society, on the contrary also compel poor to commit crimes or sometimes suicide. For instance, recently in a slump of Karachi, a disheartened father tried to take his own life, when his children who did not eat anything for days, asked him for food. In contrast, if the government or people used their money to eradicate poverty and hunger, this would have never happened.

Moreover, poverty gives birth to several other problems such as pollution, which not only affects our environment, but other species as well. In other words, when people are not able to take care of themselves, how will they be able to take care of their environment? Due to poverty, insufficient sanitary facilities and improper sewerage infrastructure in developing countries, rivers and oceans are polluted to a point that they are no more inhabitable for aquatic biodiversity. For example, a recent survey showed that a variety of fish population has been reduced to almost half in the Indus River, owing to industrial and residential waste being dumped into the river. Therefore, it is crucial to allocate funds for the development of such infrastructures, which not only improves people’s lives, on the contrary also saves other species and their habitats.

To conclude, while other people’s opinion may vary, in my opinion, the governments and the society should put in ample funding to address fundamental issues such as poverty and its related problems which directly affects people and the environment rather than on the matters that are merely the result of the above factors.",Yes,no,yes,yes,7
Some people think that current environmental issues are global problems and should therefore be dealt with by the government while others believe that these problems can only be tackled by individuals. Discuss both sides and give your opinion,"According to some people only national governments can solve the problems affecting the environment. Others counter this view and insist that individuals alone can improve the condition of the planets. In my opinion, neither the government nor the people can solve environmental issues without each other’s support.

There are certainly a lot of things that governments can do. To start with, they have the mandate of the people. The people who voted them to power have given him the authority to enact laws for protecting the environment. For example, the governments can enact laws for protecting the wildlife. It can enact laws for emission control. All of these measures play a significant role in reversing environmental damage. Afforestation, for example, is a proven way to arrest global warming. Likewise, governments alone have the resources to invest in research and development of green fuels.

On the other hand, individuals also need to contribute their bit. If each person makes a conscious effort to reduce their carbon footprint a lot of the problems affecting the planet can be tackled. They can do this by reducing their energy consumption, preventing the wastage of materials, recycling and reusing old goods. They should take public transport whenever possible and do their bit to enhance greenery in their surroundings. While these are simple measures, they will produce measurable results if they are taken by everybody.

To conclude, environmental issues can be tackled only if the governments and individuals only a concerted effort. Governments can contribute by enacting environment friendly laws and people should reduce, reuse and recycle things. ",No,yes,yes,yes,7
"Global environmental issues are the responsibility of richer nations, not poorer ones. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","As environmental problems around the world become more serious, it is important that something is done about them as soon as possible. Because we all share the same planet, it is the responsibility of everyone to protect it, although nations with more ability to fix the problem should do more.

Richer nations became rich by using the environment and this has led to the problems we have today. By using a great amount of natural resources, like oil and coal, to produce things, they created air pollution and destroyed a lot of places where plants and animals live. Therefore, they should pay to help fix the problem because they have benefited the most from damaging the environment.

On the other hand, if countries with a lot of money try to fix the world’s environmental problems, it will not matter if the poorer countries are still polluting the environment. The majority of the world’s population live in developing countries and as these places become more developed, their pollution levels also increase. For example, the world’s biggest polluter is China and its population is much more than one billion people, so even if richer countries stopped polluting, the world would still suffer from pollution.

Overall, the best way to help the environment is for everyone to take care of it. The world is connected, so even if one part of it tries to improve the condition of the environment, it will not matter. Countries that have more money should take the lead, but protecting the environment needs to be a priority for all of us. ",Yes,yes,yes,yes,7
Many people believe that global environmental problems should be dealt with internationally rather than domestically. What is your opinion?,"There is no denying that environmental issues have become extremely serious in the last decades and has been discussed by different sectors from our society. Some experts say these problems should be solved as an international matter. Other people say every country should deal with its own environmental issues. I strongly tend to agree with the former. From my standpoint, a single problem here could affect the whole world.

One major and crescent concern is related to deforestation, and we could take as an example Amazon Forest, which has been incredibly burnt since last year. The entire planet needs this forest in order to have oxygen to breathe. Consequently, every country should be concerned about Amazon issues and discuss how to combat the crimes that have occurred over there.

Another concern is about animals which are endangered and need assistance to survive. When an animal becomes extinct is the world that loses it. For this reason, this matter has to be dealt with internationally. Moreover, every single animal is essential for biodiversity and human being needs them to be alive.

Finally, another problem is the global warming that has been affected all of us. To illustrated, the ices that have been melted in the Antarctic have impacted the sea level worldwide. Moreover, this is a consequence of several issues, such as the release of dioxide carbon in the atmosphere, that an enormous number of people have contributed to occur, not only one country.

To sum up, as I see it, several environmental problems have to be dealt with internationally because they have affected the whole planet. Governments have to maintain forces to fight for a life balance and to assist many species. ",No,yes,yes,no,5.5
Many people believe that global environmental problems should be dealt with internationally rather than domestically. What is your opinion?,"A few people believe that global environmental issues ought to be resolved by the collaboration of all the nations rather than tackling it locally. I fully agree with this notion and reasons to strengthen my viewpoint are put forth in subsequent paragraphs.

First of all, solving several environmental problems in a particular location cannot give a fruitful result. As environment degrading issues such as global warming have no particular defined boundary, they can only be tackled efficiently by a joint effort of all nations. For example, resolving a problem of marine pollution by enacting strict laws for oil mining companies in one country might not resolve the problem if other countries fail to handle the same as the ocean has no physical boundary. Thus, handling of such issues is only possible by international collaboration.

Furthermore, under the influence of international treaties, countries become more accountable to control environmental issues. In other words, a nation has global pressure of facing backlash in terms of loss in international trade if they fail to follow the strict protocols of any international contract. To cite an example, under the Parris climate agreement, some countries are instructed to half their carbon dioxide emission by 2030. If they fail to fulfil, they may face consequences in terms of an international boycott. Such treaties are encouraging countries to move towards renewable sources of energy.

In addition, under-developed countries do not have enough funds to tackle increasing environmental problems on their own. Thus, sharing of funds from other developed countries or international councils can resolve this problem in a more systematic way. To illustrate, the United Nation reserves a large share of fund for poor countries such as Bangladesh, in order to provide clean solar energy to their citizens. Such funds by international organisations have proven to be quite useful for poor countries in controlling greenhouse gases.

To encapsulate, in my perspective, joint efforts of all nations can tackle rising global environmental issues in a more organised way due to the restriction from international bodies as well as sharing funds and resources. ",No,yes,yes,yes,6
Many people believe that today is a general increase in antisocial behavior and lack of respect for others. What might have caused this situation ? How to improve it?,"Nowadays, Individuals claim that, behavioral of anti-social and disrespect full towards other is increasing day by day. The issue, antisocial behavior and lack of respect generated by a plethora of reasons. This essay will discuss the reasons and how to deal with these problems.

In the first segment, I will discuss a number of situations which motive these problems. Firstly, people might have lack of education. In light of the fact that, Education is base of building personality, that teach how to behave. If a person is not educated, as result they might have incorrect mentality, and this causes anti-social and disrespectful behaviors. For instance, children have been taught in their schools to respect other, to what to do for better life. Secondly, person, he/she has a family issue, that thing depressing them. As a result, it is more likely to have that kind of behavior. They might have addictive towards drug use. Thirdly, Overwhelming works ours, From this reason a person don't have abundance time for socialism, for their family, for their children. Because of this persons' behavior become anti-social and disrespectful. These are main reasons for causing this situation.

In the second paragraph, I will suggest solutions that can improve damaged situation. To began with, The parents must ought to take care of their children, whether it is about their education, Friends, their behaviors. In addition, I will suggest that; the government should take actions of working hours of people. As a result, A person will have more time to his/her life. Also, we can campaign about awareness of anti-social. Consequently, the unaware people might get idea how to behave, how to act in front of others. These are the possible solution I can suggest.

In closing, I would like to pen down that, in the race of the modern world, we should not forget our moral values and responsibility, owing to the fact that it causes adverse effect on the world and the next generation.",No,yes,yes,yes,7
Doing an enjoyable activity with a child can develop better skills and more creativity than reading. To what extent do you agree? Use reasons and specific examples to explain your answer.,"Parents throughout the world place spend time reading with their offspring to prepare them for school where their literacy skills are further developed; however, recent research suggests that focusing on reading at an early age can be detrimental, and participating in fun activities would be far more beneficial. I am a strong advocate of this approach, and the benefits of it will be covered in this essay.

A fundamental reason for this is that there is no biological age for reading, and pushing infants to acquire this skill before they are ready could have repercussions. For example, in the UK, many boys are reluctant readers, possibly because of being forced to read, and this turned them off reading. By focusing on other activities and developing other skills such as creativity and imagination, when they are ready to read, they usually acquire this skill rapidly. In addition, the importance of encouraging creativity and developing a child’s imagination must be acknowledged. Through play, youngsters develop social and cognitive skills, for example, they are more likely to learn vocabulary through context rather than learning it from a book.

Furthermore, play allows youngsters to mature emotionally, and gain self-confidence. There is no scientific research which suggests reading at a young age is essential for a child’s development, moreover, evidence suggests the reverse is true. In Finland, early years’ education focuses on playing. Reading is only encouraged if a child shows and interest in developing this skill. This self-directed approach certainly does not result in Finnish school leavers falling behind their foreign counterparts. In fact, Finland was ranked the sixth best in the world in terms of reading.

Despite being a supporter of this non-reading approach, I strongly recommend incorporating bedtime stories into a child’s daily routine. However, reading as a regular daytime activity should be swapped for something which allows the child to develop other skills. ",No,yes,yes,yes,7
Restricting air travel is the only way to prevent air pollution. Do you agree?,"Some people believe that the only method to reduce the air pollution is to limit the number of flights. I do not agree with this viewpoint. In my opinion limiting the number of flights may reduce the air pollution to some extent; however, other measures such as regulating the use of various private modes of transportation such as motorized vehicles and creating awareness about the appalling affects of air pollution can be more fruitful.

To begin with, it is undeniable that airplanes cause air pollution as they produce a huge amount of carbon dioxide which causes a lot of pollution in the atmosphere and leads to global warming. For example, it is estimated by Green Peace that up to 13, 000 tonnes of CO2 is released into the atmosphere every year by planes, thus increasing the carbon footprint in the air. Although it is possible to control this pollution by reducing the frequency of flights, it will not fully solve the problem, because the majority of pollutants in the air do not come from aircrafts and as such it cannot be considered the number one cause of air contamination.

By contrast, the major cause of air pollution is the emission of poisonous gases by motor vehicles and factories. There are millions of cars on the roads and the vast majority of them run on fossil fuels which cause the emission of dangerous gases. Factories also release obnoxious gases into the atmosphere and reduce air quality. Therefore, limiting the use of such polluting means of transport can be a better solution to mitigate the effect of air pollution. Also factories should be moved from cities to sparsely populated areas. Additionally, the state should educate people about the dangers of polluting the air that we breathe in and encourage them to use non-polluting modes such as bicycles and walking for short distances.

In conclusion, although restricting airways can lessen the air pollution, it is not the perfect solution. Pollution is caused by a number of factors and aircrafts just one of them. Hence, restricting air travel is not the right solution to air pollution. ",No,no,yes,yes,6
Restricting air travel is the only way to prevent air pollution. Do you agree?,"Clean air is one of the most vital things for the survival of life on the earth. However, these days its quality has deteriorated because of pollution. Many people think that if there is a limitation on the number of flights around, then the situation will improve. In my opinion, this is an impractical and incomplete solution.

To commence with, people think of aeroplanes as the biggest source of air pollution because they fly and a large amount of fuel is required to generate energy to go up in the atmosphere against the force of gravity. Moreover, in order to continue the flight, energy is needed to maintain the relative velocity against the atmosphere. The combustion of this fuel releases 13, 000 tonnes of harmful gases. Therefore, if there is a decline in the rate of the flying, then this combustion will be decreased and there will be lesser harm to the nature.

On the contrary, reduction in the air travel is not the most effective option for resolution. Firstly, the vehicles on the road cause much more damage to the natural habitat as compared to the aeroplanes. For instance, there is a release of 75, 000 tonnes of harmful gases from the vehicles on the road, which is much higher than the release from the aviation. In addition, the fuel used in aircrafts is highly efficient as there is need to keep the aircraft as light as possible. Secondly, it is an impractical solution because it has enabled humans to navigate from one corner of the world to another within few hours. So, there is more usability of aviation.

To conclude, putting restrictions on the rate of aviation is not a viable solution to prevent the air pollution. According to me, discovering cleaner methods of generation of energy not just for the aeroplanes, but road traffic and factories as well, could be much more effective resolution.

"World history suggests that violence and conflict were more evident under male leadership than under female leadership. So, for peace to prevail, female leadership can be considered as a better option than male leadership. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","The human history has been violence and conflict-stricken since the beginning of the human existence. If we look back in history or to the world around us, we see wars, conflict, power struggles and revolutions, peace making kings, prudent emperors and ruthless rulers. History also reveals that society has always been predominantly male dominated, with leaders and rulers mainly being men. It is, hence, easy to blame the ruler and put the responsibility of atrocities on the shoulders of men. But a deeper perspective always reveals to historians that conflict is a generic tendency of humans. So peace being disturbed is not the liability of men only, but humans in general, and a power shift, from men to women, is destined to be futile in prevailing peace.

Most of the women who are known to be great till date, e. g. Queen Isabella of Spain, Queen Mary, a. k. a. Bloody Mary, Victoria, and Elizabeth of Britain, all have ruled over a vast spectrum of power. And they often have done so ruthlessly, achieving goals with an iron hand. They have waged wars that are barely comparable to only a few of those devised by men. These women are not anomalies of history, but examples from numerous others, who went beyond the boundaries of gender in the path of prevailing in power while expanding peace whenever they deemed it to be expandable.

The two greatest wars of modern history, World Wars I & II, have taught us that wars are impersonal. Race, religion, nationality, sex are only pretences to the universally human lust for power. It is true that during both the global conflicts men were in the rulers’ thrones. But it will be foolish to say that Margaret Thatcher, the famed Iron Lady who spared no road against a minnow enemy in the war of Falkland, would be more peacefully diplomatic than how the greats Winston Churchill and Franklyn D. Roosevelt had been tackling the Axis of Hitler.

The gender issue is only a determinant in the battle of the sexes, not the battles among nations and peoples. It is therefore, impertinent, if not irrational, to conclude that world conflicts result from the rule of a particular gender and the finer sex would do a better job at prevailing peace if selectively put at the helm of human nations.

Some people say that the main environmental problem of our time is the loss of particular species of plants and animals . others say that there are more important environmental problems .discuss both views and give your own openion.,"Many Individuals discern that the fundamental environmental issues are from disappearing significant grosses and animals, while others believe that this is not the only environmental dilemma nowadays. I am of the belief that the environmental problem mainly caused by human activities. In the following lines this essay will be illustrated.

In this time, environment issues increasingly as long as the disappearing of some significant of wildlife, and this paly a crucial role in environmental balance which impact on human beings. In other words, the diversity of wild habitat bring a stable balance in life. A prim example. According to experts that the excess of the rabbits in many countries as a result of the cates does not exist any more and this this become a crisis to country live on cates in their meals. Thus, it can be observed that diversity of wild life specious it is paramount to get a suitable habitats.

While, there is another public consensus that human activities is the major principle to the environmental crisis. To illustrate, the emission of the transportation releases from vehicle has introduced to global worming and wildlife dilemma. For instance, In Egypt, the issues of transportation trigger respiratory diseases. As a result, It can be said that there is many civil wars which impede environmental stability.

To conclude, After, this essay illustrate that some individuals argued that disappear of some significant types of animal is the main reason for habitat dilemma while others seen that human projects. Moreover, I am of the belief that industrial countries are in charge of global worming. ",No,yes,yes,yes,6
"Some people believe that it is best to accept a bad situation, such as an unsatisfactory job or shortage of money. Others argue that it is better to try and improve such situation","Many individuals discern that working with high salary is preferred whatever the situation you can faced, while others with that experience become from getting such this situation. I am of the believe that work with high salary not a cozy work environment is a regretable for doing it. In the following lines that essay will be illustrated.

Work experience has a crucial role on employee, and this can also impact on the behaviors. In other word, when workers faced a trouble issue in his work, he might retried easily although if he accepr such mistakes he will be acceptable for hard works and his manger may raise his salary and this job becom a thriving job for him. A prime example, WhatsApp owners suffer to sell his project and tried several times with Facebook and Tweeters producers however his idea became much more popular around the world. Thus, It can be assumed that nations should overcome the mistakes to get much more knowledge.

Passion for people in life should be respect, and this can happen by the continuous searching for better work. To illustrate, immigration has increasingly recent years as a result a lot of immigrates went to developed countries searching for a well paid job. For instance, In Egypt many resident went abroad away from their families to raise their living. Hence, it is illustrated that whatever one’s dilemma, he must do his best to achieve his dreams.

To conclude, after this essay has illustrated the two point of view of the feeling toward their job and how can you tackled this. it can be reiterated that experience should respect because some people need to focus on improving their career while others argued that face your problem whatever the lower efficiency you can get from it. Moreover, I am of the believe that individuals skills are increasingly observed in a suitable job environment. ",No,yes,yes,yes,6
Certain people think that violence and conflict were more evident under male leadership than under female leadership since the dawn of the time.,"Certain people think that violence and conflict were more evident under male leadership than under female leadership since the dawn of the time. Throughout the history, Male leadership encourages violence and some other sets of people suggest considering female leadership to prevail peace.

The issue whether or not 'female leadership can be considered as a better option to prevail peace' is always a debatable issue. There are strong arguments from both the sides and let us discuss in a detailed way.

Firstly, World history clearly suggests violence were more evident under male leadership. An instance illustrating this in action is first and second world wars. Male leadership encouraged violence in those 2 worlds wars and it is proved that violence is more evident under male leadership. In addition to this, women are against violence by nature and suffer a lot because of the violence thus the women leadership always try to prevail peace. For example, some Asian countries tried to restore the peace during women leadership. It is obvious from this that women leadership can be considered to bring back the peace

There is always an opposite side of the coin. Certain women leadership proved that they are ready to encourage violence. To illustrate this, Pakistan started a war during women leadership and it clearly proves that peace cannot be restored by changing leadership. In addition to this, Bangladesh also saw a great deal of internal violence during women leadership only. It is clearly proved that violence can be evident under women leadership also.

Thus it is recommended, to prevail peace in all circumstances irrespective of women or men leadership. Peace can prevail in many ways and consider female leadership is only one of those options.

Tuition fees are often said to inflict financial accountability on students’ and their families’ shoulder.,"Tuition fees are often said to inflict financial accountability on students’ and their families’ shoulder. the unavoidable high expenditure that universities are involved in will be discussed as the main issue, followed by the payment of student tuition by the government provide that hiring student in governmental position after graduate.

Universities are under a great deal of costs and the major drive of this problem would seem to be education facilities such as educational equipment, staff’s and pedagogical experts’ payment. This is not to say that there is no source of income for universities, but government grants and charitable donations, as an example, would not be adequate to cover for the aforementioned expenses. Universities decision-maker, therefore, would tend to raising tuition fees in order to meet the financial purposes. This policy exerts intensive financial pressure on knowledge-seekers and their families.

Turing to possible solutions, an obvious step would be for government to invite universities to create new curriculum for students that are easy to hire in state-owned companies after graduation. This joint-venture, could not only provide fresh employees for government but also diminish the financial pressure on educational applicants. Doing so, would result in academic centers coping with the sheer costs mentioned above. This way, to desire outputs would be introduced, the former of which is that the role of students and their families in financial matter would be lessened and latter is that universities are no longer worried about their costs.

Overall, the cost of attaining a higher-level education is enormous for education recipients. One of the main cause of this situation is high disbursement that academic centers, as mentioned above, deal with it. This problem could be ameliorated if governments, collaborate with universities, pay students' debt as long as students engage to governmental jobs. ",No,no,yes,no,6
"Some employers want to be able to contact their staff at all times, even on holidays. Does this development have more advantages than disadvantages ?","Nowadays most managers finds it necessary to reach out to their staffs on phone all the time, even while on vacations. The drawbacks of this trend outweighs the benefits. This essay will further elaborate on this stated view point.

On one hand, organizations set out task on a daily, weekly or monthly bases and as such employees are required to work extra shifts even on days they’re off duty. Nevertheless, in this era of technology some of this companies has stepped up by giving their workers mobile phones or registered SIM cards in which they can be contacted at all times. more also this can also serve as a means of communicating with their colleagues outside work hours in other to relay urgent information concerning the establishment. However, this strategy has brings in positive outcomes for example: my company gave out registered SIM cards with free airtime to all permanent staffs and this has been effective in communicating the daily work schedule to junior colleagues and also some workers on leave.

On the other hand, one of the demerits of this is interfering in the personal life’s of the employee and mental breakdown. Although not everyone loves to receive calls from work after their closing hour or when they’re off shift. So many people pass through the heavy traffic of the city and struggles to get home late just to spend quality time with their families. Receiving a distress call from a boss or colleague is rather frustrating as this would get a torn on ones mental health. In addition, some individuals don’t even get to see their children before rushing out the house in other to beat traffic, so the only time they can spare with their loved ones is when they’re on vacation, off shift or even after work. Despite the positive side, this new evolution is rather detrimental to one’s mental health and privacy. For instance a survey done on workers in 2001 shows that 70% of the population have mental disorders as a result of work overload and stress from workplace.

In conclusion, most Companies like to stay in touch with their works, while this is a good profitable to firms the sets backs leads the employees to mental distress and deprived them spending time with their families. ",No,no,yes,yes,6
"Many people work long hours, leaving very little time for leisure activities. Does this situation have more advantages or more disadvantages? Give reason for your answer and include any relevant example from your own knowledge or experience.","A great number of people are working for long hours, thus having barely any time for leisure interests. In my opinion, this situation brings about more disadvantages for both the individual and the society.

Firstly, working for long duration and not having enough time for physical activities or hobbies can lead people to be victims of numerous hazardous health issues. It is of no doubt that in the pursuit of money and career goals one will definitely neglect one’s health. For example, those whose jobs require them to sit glued to their computer screen might become obese in the long run. In addition to that, starring at the screen for long hours can entail different types of eye diseases such as eye strain and blurry vision. Moreover, it is an undeniable fact that one will most probably suffer from mental illnesses like stress and depression if one does not dedicate a certain amount of time for practicing leisure activities, be it indoors or outdoors.

Working overtime has a negative impact on the society as well. It is true that when people living in the same area engage in a / practice a common activity, ties between them are reinforced, thus leaving room for socialisation and making friends. Therefore, having little time devoted for hobbies and interests can somehow jeorpardise one’s relationship with the society. Sometimes, one needs to get out of one’s circle, befriend new people with whom one can share one’s happiness and sorrow.

So as maintained earlier, I believe that people must strike a balance between their professional and personal lives to avoid being victims of various health issues and to create and live in a better society. ",No,yes,yes,yes,6.5
some people believe that violence on tv and in computer games has a damaging effect on the society. Other deny that these factors have any significant influence on people's behaviour. What is your opinion?,"Television and computer games are one of the biggest inventions of their time. Some say that violence on these digital devices are damaging our society. I completely agree with this statement and I will support my argument with examples. Firstly, T. V and computer games have copyrights to show such contents just for entertainment but mostly people takes its negative impact such as most of movies and drama seriels running these days have adverse type of household fightings which lead to the cause of domestics issues specially between husband and a wife. Quarelling between inlaws and much more. Every person just want to do like tv screens which in result create bad effect on society. On the other hand, violence in computer games mostly effects teenagers. One of the finest example is Pubg running these days. Every young guys just want to roam like these gangsters with arms and guns which in result threaten our society. They just want to live their lives like them which distrubs the environment of our society. However, there are other people who take the positive impacts of them like changing their life style, learn good language but they are fewer. So that, it has more negative impacts rather than favouring it.

The majority of the population / most people around the world are busier than ever putting in long hours at work and spending little time with their families and also missing out on their hobbies.,"The majority of the population / most people around the world are busier than ever putting in long hours at work and spending little time with their families and also missing out on their hobbies. This trend has more drawbacks than benefits because it might affect them mentally and lead to health problems.

In the first place, when we put in / spend long hours at work it will exhaust us both physically and mentally. In addition, it builds pressure / stress which might affect us in the long run. In reality, the human brain can work at its optimal level for only a few hours at a stretch. If we work beyond that our productivity and wellness will be affected. To demonstrate, many people who work in the software industry do not have a fixed time on their schedule and it prevents them from having a leisure activity like going for a walk or playing a sport. According to a survey people who do this kind of desk jobs are at potential risk for obesity, diabetes, and heart related issues.

Not having enough time for leisure and family can also lead to conflicts within the family. People should be able to strike a work-life balance; spending the whole day at work will affect their relationship with their spouse and children. Burnout is another problem. When people work without a break, they lose the motivation to continue. Of course, there might be some minor advantages like earning overtime pay; however, this advantage is easily eclipsed by the major disadvantages of working without having time for leisure.

In conclusion, long working hours not only hurt our productivity but also make us prone to developing various ailments. Hence, I believe that there are more disadvantages than advantages to this practice,",No,yes,yes,no,5.5
"Many people work long hours, leaving very little time for leisure activities. Does this situation have more advantages or more disadvantages?","In the modern era, a vast proportion of people often works unnecessarily long hours to accomplish their task at the cost of leisure and family time. There are numerous pros and cons towards long hours in the office. However, there are more disadvantages and two of the key points are explained in the below essay.

Firstly, work is an aspect of life that can never be accomplished despite the long hours. This is because as soon as one task is finished, the next one is already following it, an individual needs to be smart enough to understand that he or she has done sufficient for work for the day and the reminder of the time is meant for his or her family and children. Consider the work life imbalance in Japan, this country is a classical example to illustrate this scenario most of the younger workforce often tend to stay over time simply because they need to impress their managers and this results in absolutely no time for their personal use. This stands out as a negative point towards the nation's time life culture.

Secondly, having the appropriate time off from office can improve productivity. This has been proven by scientific research and also experimented in several European countries. Countries such as Finland and Denmark have even implemented the switch from 5 working days to 4, to increase the People's efficiency. Furthermore, besides productivity, time off also aids in the improvement of the person's mental health. A healthy mind is a fit mind and that ultimately, this leads to more work being accomplished, Is this not what the goal of long hours was trying to achieve? .

In conclusion, having worked extra time does not have any major merit, instead, it has quite a few demerits. Long hours do not result in completing the work as work itself never finishes. Moreover, not only does it limit the relaxation time of the person but it also reduces their output. ",Yes,no,No,yes,5.5
"Most Students believe that Online studies during covid 19 are helpful, to what extent do you agree?","Where Pandemic has changed so much in us, studies are also adversely effected. Just to cope with the loss of studies, virtual classrooms during pandemic are the most effective way to study, I agree to this argument because one can never put life in danger and this extensive loss of studies is unbearable.

Supporting the statement, the covid-19 has taken so much from us, our children and students are the future of tomorrow, no nation would ever think to loose them. School and universities were closed in the spur of moment when covid-19 was born, even me as a student was fearful to go out for my class. For instance, my exams were delayed, when cases were increasing to the peak.

With covid-19 in the air, the loss of studies is the most itching part, virtual classes were the great cover, students were sticking back to their routine of studying daily. From primary to higher level, students were shifted towards the digital classes, exams were conducted online to make the things floating with the stances going on. New ways to study were discovered, like my practicals were conducted online using digital simulations.

I conclude to that, to cope with this situation, studies should be conducted online so that we can save us and others most importantly and the unbearable loss of time and studies can be saved. It should be understood that we must learn to live with pandemic and try our best to bring things back to the route and the only most effective way to do that is through these virtual rooms.

some people say that history is more important school subject. OTHER PEOPLE THINK THAT IN TODAYS WORLD SUBJECT LIKE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN HISTORY .DISCUSS BOTH VIEWS AND GIVE YOUR OPINION,"some people believe that subjects like History and Social Studies are essential and more compelling as young generation can learn good things from it. In contrast, other thinks that there are some other subjects such as Science and Technology that are more significant in comparison to History. The reason behind their approach is that, today's world is completely dependant on science and this era is know as Technology era. I believe that, both groups are right in their thinking but I am in a bit more support of second group.

Firstly, people think that History is mandatory as it provides the information information and details of the events that happened in the past. History tells people especially children and adults about the struggles of the founder and protector of their country that subsequently makes them privileged and grateful towrads them. They could become more faithful and patriotic. Leaning about world's History makes people more broad minded and less judgemental.

However, there are some people who believe that because of this advancing age. subjects like Science and technology are more helpful and and useful for society. By learning these subjects people could become more beneficial not only towards the mankind but also could make progress on an individual level. In today's world, everything is processed by technology. People are using electrical appliances, mobile phone, computers and so on. All these things are invented by scientist and IT experts not by History writers and readers. Hence learning the Science and Technology subjects is more essential to the people as compared to the History. For instance, because of Science, people are getting vaccine for the world's worst pandemic disease named covid-19 (Corona Virus) and people who do not care about the precautionary measure and violate the rule and restriction by their own country's government can be caught by police because of satellite technology.

To conclude, every subject has their own significance and learning about History could be advantageous to get and accumulate knowledge but in my opinion subjects like science and technology in this world are more mandatory to learn as to live in this modern era we need to equipped ourselves with science knowledge instead of History.",No,no,yes,yes,6

I do agree with the statement that it helps students to such extent in order to make their study status smooth & flawless in quarantine period. During covid-19 situation, where pandemic era at it peak & people are scared of catching virus, online studies kept students calm & motivated by replacing safe & sound way of learning from anywhere & anytime. Students got online access to update their education status during the outbreak of covid-19. It has been stated here that student got expertise on communication & verbal skills by adopting modern online way of study. Besides it, negative impact reflects that few students can not get access for a e-technology in an easy to participate appropriately & timely.

It is concluded here that online study during covid-19 situation helps students to enhance their online learning sills, & get in touch with an updated technology with full potential.
