"In the future, more people will choose to go on holiday in their own country and not travel abroad on holiday. Do you agree or disagree?","Convenience of modern transportation shortens the distance between places and people embark on their travel more frequently than it has ever been, whether traveling domestically or aboard become another dilemma when people planning a trip. A short joy domestic travel seems optimistic for masses. However, exotic culture and various weather which travelling aboard offered will never been found in travel at home. It is disagreed that more people will choose to spending their holiday at home instead of abroad.

Compared with domestic traveling, oversea travel seems irreplaceable in terms of exotic culture experience which only available at the place of origin, for example, the folk music and operas will exclusively presented locally, such distinctive culture shows are barely found in domestic travel. Therefore, a home trip will not be a substitution of foreign traveling.

Apart from culture, the differences in weather will not be observed in a home travel, for instance, tropical weather drastically differs from dessert weather which result in diversification of plants and animals. Experience in various weather and environment undoubtedly brings brand-new recognition of the world, such recognition cannot be achieved easily in home traveling, thus traveling aboard will be the only option for those who travel to retain more recognition of the world.

In conclusion, the extraordinary culture experience and diversification of environment under various weather undeniably adding joy we have ever experience at home. For such reasons, it is crystal clear that travel abroad will remain trending and replacement of domestic traveling to travel abroad will not be realized. ",No,Yes,6.5
"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Providing Internet access is just as important as other services, such as building roads, so governments should offer Internet access to all of their citizens at no cost.","Today, the Internet serves as our maps, our encyclopedias, and sometimes, our lifelines for social interactions, so the internet is crucial in shaping people's lives. I think the accessibility of the internet is vitally similar to other public utilities so the government should encourage people with free internet access. This step helps to improve educational services and employment opportunities.

In the first place, although public transportation aids in the commuting process, free internet enables people to increase their knowledge. Folks can utilize the facilities on the internet to pursue their dreams. For example, Cloie, one of my friends dropped out of college due to unaffordability, However, in Mexico government's experimental plan of giving the internet to the public gave her an opportunity to continue her studies online. She enrolled in the arts program in People College and attended classes online because of interrupted internet services, so if the internet services are free students like Cloie can get access to education with nominal fees.

In the second place, people will enhance their lives with better opportunities if they have the internet than infrastructure facilities. This means the internet contains an abundance of information regarding job postings and skills needed for acing interviews. For example, when I was in Jampet, our society was not equipped with facilities except roads. However, with crowd funding young people in my area provided free internet access to fellow people. As a result, many of the youth used internet for filling the job applications and learned skills from the internet. Thereby, they not only acquired skills for jobs but also participated in interview process. Thus, free internet provided our area people with better job placements and acquired skillsets for their careers. So, if government considered the plan of providing internet without any charge people would improve their lives with better possibilities.

In essence, I think government should provide free internet access for educational and employment purposes for enhancing people's lives, so I agree with the statement. ",No,Yes,6
Children are getting 10% weight from past year.Give your causes and effects?,"It is often argued that in western society, the rate of overweight child has been increased around 20% in terms of 10 years. There are many causes and effects which would be discuss in following fragment.

The main causes and effects for overweight children is due to their food habitat and lack of physical exercise. Many children at present days like to eat junk food outside which is bad to our health. Due to this type of food intake their weight get increased rapidly in small age. Another problem is Physical exercise. children have latest technology like videogames, computer, Television which makes them lazy and make habits of involving into it hours to hours. Due to this activity many children are getting lazy and effecting their health and habitat.

To overcome with this problem, there are many solution to it. But some solution are Physical exercise and participating with friends. For induce, Instead of playing videogames inside the house. If children play outside with their friends then it help them to improve their habitat. Where as another factor for improving their health is sports, if children play sports which they find more interesting it will help them to be active and fit. Healthy food play vital role to children. Parents should prevent to children's not to eat junk food which is easily available in market place. They should provide nutrient food which makes them healthy.

Overall we can conclude that due to junk food and lack of physical activities our today generation is being lazy and inactive due to which it is effecting to their health and life. To overcome this effects, healthy food and sports helps them to be active and wealthy. If this activity is done to children then we can today generation children more beneficial in future.

"Scientists predict in the near future cars will be driven by computers, not people. Why? Do you think it is a positive or negative development?","In the upcoming years, cars and other vehicles are projected to be driven automatically by computers. From my perspective, this phenomenon brings more advantages than disadvantages.

First, there are several driving forces behind this forecast. Steadily increasing budget from the government and giant corporations has brought about groundbreaking advances in robotics technology. The last few decades have witnessed robots gradually takes over manufacturing jobs previously done by human. Soon enough, automation will become a ubiquitous presence in our daily life, handling a variety of tasks including driving. In addition, given that traffic accidents are on the rise, especially in densely populated cities, self-driving cars could be the answer to reduce fatalities. Simply by taking human emotions and errors out of the equation, autopilot mode could indeed save millions of lives from car crash incidence.

Having said that, the benefits of autonomous cars certainly outweigh the drawbacks. Operated with a high degree of precision, self-driving vehicles can greatly reduce average commuter times in metropolitan areas, offering many spin-off advantages from well-being to boosting the economy. Besides, with driverless cars able to access up-to-the-minute data to help monitor traffic, as well as digital maps and other tools, they could determine the fastest, most efficient route possible. All of this will result in less congestion, less time-consuming and fuel waste.

In short, growing level of automation in this modern era is inevitable. More specifically, the emergence of self-driving technology is around the corner and despite initial concerns, this should be perceived as a positive trend. ",No,Yes,6.5
The animal species are becoming extinct due to human activities on land and in sea. What are the reasons and solutions?,"It’s frightening that myriads of terrestrial and marine animals are on the verge of extinction due to human beings. My essay will shed light on the causes and measures to this issue.

To begin with, the constant tampering of nature by human has led to drastic changes in the natural world resulting in animals and plants finding it more difficult and difficult to survive. Nearly every kind of habitat or ecosystem - be it land, air or water - has been affected by the uncontrollable destruction of habitats by human. The impact of humans taking land for buildings, farming and timber has rendered species extinct at speeds unprecedented in Earth’s history. Besides, humans, due to their industrial, agricultural, or normal day-to-day activities, release an inordinate amount of toxic waste that is eventually dumped into the air, water or landfills. Tragedies like oil spills have been known to destroy and threaten many aquatic life forms.

Having said that, rapid, greatly intensified efforts to address the problem, slowing the extinctions currently underway. First, each government should levy exorbitant fines on devastating behaviors such as littering, illegal dumping or other environmental offences. The implementation of stringent laws, accompanied by extensive media coverage of the issue would raise environmental awareness among all sections of the society. Second, international organizations such as the United Nations should coordinate activities among member countries as well as encourage participation by the private sectorto promote sustainable use of the world’s natural resources. Specifically, the presence of such inter-governmental organizations plays a major role in initiating negotiations on reducing industrial pollution level or other toxic waste.

In short, the blame for the most recent mass extinction is not natural calamities - it’s human. Therefore, several solutions need to be done to tackle this worrying trend and save endangered species from the brink of extinction. ",No,Yes,6.5
"some people think all lawbreakers should be put into prison, while others believe that there are better alternatives. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","We have witnessed many crimes in modern society. It is argued that all of the lawbreakers should be sent to jail, while others think that there are better alternative choices for lawbreakers to amend themselves. In my opinion, these statements are reasonable.

It is certainly true that lawbreakers should be taken into the prison for some reasons. One of the reasons is that this policy can to protect the inhabitants of cities. Lawbreakers usually commit crimes that will bring harms to the others such as stealing and robbing. By sending crime offenders to prisons, it can ensure that the society safety. As a result, citizens subsequently would feel that the society is peaceful and secured. Another reason is that this action reduce the crime rate. By strictly imposing punishment to criminals, it will decrease the level of crime rate because it has deterrent effects. Consequently, people would give up the thought of committing crimes.

However, there are opposing voices saying that there are better ways to solve this problem. To begin with, the government should offer jobs to criminals. Re-offenders, in most cases, are struggling with extremely limited income in their lives. Given secured jobs and reasonable payments, they naturally can learn some practical skills such as computer skills. Therefore, they will not risk their liberty because they live like ordinary residents with sufficient income. Apart from this, the government should provide free education to them. Due to leak of educating in the past, perpetrators were unable to judge what was right and wrong things to do. Being significantly educating, they will become good members and will not return to crime. ",No,Yes,6.5
"Multicultural societies, in which there is a mixture of different ethnic peoples, bring more benefits than drawbacks to a country. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own experience or knowledge","Thanks to more widely open policies in economy and immigration of many countries, the 21st century has witnessed the surprisingly increasing formation of multicultural societies where a varying number of ethnic people stay together. Although it has both positive and negative effects to a country, it seems to me that we are more likely to obtain more benefits than disadvantages from this kind of society.

The more diverse the residents of a country are, the more cultural values they can share to enhance their awareness and knowledge of culture and tradition. People will get more directly engaged in understanding unique customs or rituals, life and work attitudes from their foreign neighbours, colleagues and friends. As a consequence, they enable to adapt the cultural diversity in order to develop their interpersonal skills and live closer to other cultures without having to live in person in another country.

Additionally, once people can know more about each other through everyday interactions at work or schools, the severe conflicts or even wars will be remarkably alleviated. It is undeniable that there might have some drawbacks that multicultural communities bring to a country. Racial disparity accelerated, the wealth-poverty gap deteriorated, different culture tensions are specific cases for what are the so-called drawbacks, but the inhabitants can overcome these when the government implement friendly-ethnic peoples’ policies, as well as the dwellers, have positive thoughts and behaviours to live compatibly with others.

Stimulating multiculturalism in a society will offer numerous advantages to a country rather than undesirable effects. Therefore, each individual should savour every rewarding moment of living in their multicultural community and proudly spread their unique traditions to international friends so as to increase the diversity.

Some people say that the only reason for learning reason for learning a foreign language is in order to travel to or work in a foreign country. Others say that these are not the only reasons why someone should learn a foreign language. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.,"There are a variety of reasons why people should learn a foreign language. Some people say that the only reason is to live or work overseas. On the other hand, others believe that there are many more reasons. In my opinion, travel and work abroad should not the only motives.

Undoubtedly, traveling and working overseas are the most common reasons for learning a new language. When people decide to work and settle away from their countries, there are many struggles, and one of them is cultural barriers. However, knowing the native language can help newcomers overcome the problems easier. Besides that, partially or fully understand the local language can make travelers enjoy their trips more. On the other hand, , because there are more and more unemployed workers, employers also have higher expectations, and knowing (that) another language would be a great advantage. In short, knowing another language is necessary for jobs and travel abroad.

On the other hand, , there are other benefits of knowing a foreign. Some studies show that the brains of bilinguals think and work differently from normal ones. Bilinguals can take in information, and they process it more complex and diverse. As a result, knowing a new language broaden our mind. We can think from various perspectives, and we will know more about the world around us.

In conclusion, in my opinion, knowing a foreign language can help us in jobs and travel. However, besides that, there are many benefits and reasons why we should learn a new language. ",No,Yes,6
Newspapers and books are outdated. Why do some people believe this? What is your opinion?,"The twenty-first century illustrates an increasing number of people are relying on new forms of technology. A possible consequence of this is that traditional media such as books and newspapers are not common, and these documents are considered to be outdated. Personally, I disagree with this point of view, books and newspapers should be a basic way of saving knowledge and traditional culture.

The principal reason that some people give this view is discovering information in the global from the internet or multimedia such as television, podcast channel is much quicker and easier. For instance, if people use Google or another search engine, they can instantly get the latest news. The fact that technology gives more convenience in browsing information, but most of these are the fast-moving news, and when an individual wants to research or directly interact with the words, in reality, the traditional platform such as research reports, academic notebooks are more essential than the high-technical platform.

Furthermore, reading print books and newspapers can be better for the brain and health. Because readers of print books absorb and remember more of the plot than readers of e-books or digital magazines. For example, many jobs require people to stare at a computer screen all day, and it will give their eyes a break. Electronic books can cause screen fatigue, which may lead to blurred vision, dryness, and irritation, with print books, those problems do not occur any more. In addition, researchers believe that if readers have a books or personal library at home, they will be more likely to link to higher academic achievement.

E-books and internet platforms would be more convenient than traditional books. But the important thing is reading on paper books can enrich the entire experience, and readers will not be got sidetracked more easily than digital readers. Thus, traditional reading will not be outdated. ",No,Yes,6.5
Depression and anxiety disorders among Adults,"Nowadays, the most of Adults constantly face with the stress, problems in their business life, private life. All of these worsen them morally and cause depression, anxiety, social phobia which completely frustrate their mental health and the foremost their life.

On one hand, from my point of view, Adults are charge of so many responsibilities such as about their children’s future, job, family affairs, meeting their child’s needs, etc. and each of them causes stress on middle-aged people. That is way disorders as depression and anxiety usually occur on Adults. In my opinion, it is mainly bound up business life that they spare the most of their day in there. Actually this depends on the type of work. Some jobs may be so stressful, for instance, profession of a doctor. Saving someone’s life requires too much responsibility and self-sacrifice and from my stand point, such as professions results anxiety. However place of doctors is undeniable in our life.

On another hand, one of liability of Adults is about their children. They have to meet their needs as affording their education, buying them necessary things and sometimes they think more and more deeply about it. They consider that what if I am laid off, cannot meet my child’s significant needs. Hence, All of these thoughts make them depressed and create uneasiness on them.

To sum up, What they need is to chill out, think less and occasionally walking away from responsibilities. Unless they do it, they will deal with diverse illnesses, due to it is evident fact that depression and anxiety create harmful diseases like cancer. ",No,Yes,6.5
"Write about the following topic: In the past, most people lived in small villages where everyone knew everyone else. Nowadays, most people live in large cities where they only know a few people in their area. What do you think were the advantages and disadvantages of living in a small community? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge and experience.","In the past, we lived in small communities, small villages and nowadays we are living in a big communities, large cities. But let's focus on the past, what was the advantages and disadvantages of a living in a small communities.

I think advantages of living in a small communities was people didn't feel awkward with each other because they were close. If any of family in the village had a emergency problem, they can called help from other quickly because there house were against to each other,

About the disadvantages of living in a small villages was they got bored of their neighboor and people surrounded them because they were too similar. They didn't get a choice to communicate with new people outside their area so their social communication skill was limited. They didn't have many new friends.

In my opinion, living in a small villages let you to live close to your family and friends. But, you can just live like that, I love to experience new things and communicate with different people. Living in a big city is appropriate for me. ",No,Yes,6.5
Major environmental problem,"Many people think that the loss of particular plants and animal species is the major environmental problem that humans are facing nowadays, while others believe that some environmental issues are more alarming. I agree with the latter view and will analyze both views in the following essay.

On the one hand, the loss of animal and plant species is considered a main environmental problem because of its impact on our planet’s biodiversity. Around the world, trees are being cut down for industrial and agricultural purposes. As a result, there will not be enough trees to produce oxygen for humans and prevent the soil from washing away. Meanwhile, endangered animals are being poached to serve people’s needs, hence negatively affecting the whole ecosystem. For example, when sharks are killed for their fins, many types of aquatic species no longer have their natural predators to control their population. Consequently, the disappearance of predators disrupts the natural food chain and then leads to unbalanced underwater ecosystems.

On the other hand, there are more urgent environmental issues that exist aside from the loss of plant and animal species. Those problems including pollution and climate change are the main factors that cause the loss of biodiversity and put the natural habitat on the brink of destruction. Water and soil pollution caused by industrial and agricultural activities are poisoning a large number of species of marine and land animals, which means that human health is also negatively affected as those animals are humans’ important food source. Moreover, changing weather patterns caused by climate change lead to more frequent occurrences of natural disasters such as droughts, floods, and wildfires.

In conclusion, the loss of particular plants and animals should indeed be paid great attention to, but other environmental issues should also be taken into consideration. I think we should put a great deal of effort into tackling all of those problems rather than only focusing on the animals and plants’ extinction. ",No,Yes,6.5
Individuals can do nothing to improve the environment; only governments and large companies can make a difference.,"Some people say that there is no need for any individual to help for the improvement of the environment because they believe that it only depends on the performance of the government and huge companies. I totally disagree to this idea. I believe that every individual is important through participating and encouraging awareness to all.

Everyone is essential. Any good plans for the betterment of the environment has to be started by an individual. The goal will only be achieve if every part of the community will participate. For example, the government had announce about the global warming prevention and tips on how to do it, they need the participation of every individual so that the goal may be accomplish, because if people will only hear about it without any action from them, the goal will not be met.

Also, any individual can be an instrument to encourage awareness to all that they will encounter. If anyone had been intentionally doing his/her part for the project, the outcome will be positive. One good example is being member of a family, let us say that the mother heard about the project of the government to save the earth by starting from segregating garbage in different ways which are garbage, recycling and compost. The mom can be a good encourager by first doing it by herself, then next is to teach her husband and kids to do it as well. This is a good contribution to the government's project that may lead to a positive outcome.

In conclusion, every individual is essential for the goal of improving the environment. If there is no individual involvement, success in achieving the goal is impossible. ",No,Yes,6.5
"The first man to walk on the moon claimed it was a step forward for mankind. However, it has made little difference in most people’s lives.

"Some people think that the government should provide assistance to all kinds of artists including painters, musicians and poets. However, other people think that this is a waste of money. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Many people lives are richer because of their art which they express to community. Many individual believe that the government should provide funds to artist while other believe that it is unfair. This essay analyse both the perspectives.

To begin with former views, there are many points that authority should help artists. Artists are contribute to nation by their art. Creativity is having in every person by their born but to elaborate it is a vital thing for any individual and all artist do that. At the end, they serve their creativity to their community for entertain perpose. Additionally, artist represent their culture by their art so, they become ambassador of their nation. For an example, painters represent their art by emboss as well as sculpture represent by carving and engraving and could be popular worldwide and express their tradition.

Moving to a latter view counter of former view having a strong reasons. Government should firstly focus on basic need for developing country. Individual's primary need is accommodation shelter and food yet, many individual has not get it. For well being life of human is a foremost priority for authority and still thye focus on other art instead this primary things. Additionally, they should also focus on infrastructure development. Nation want to add their name in developed country, foremost of it is developed their urban, ruler and their transportation by providing more found in it.

To conclude and my opinion is, although the art is part of culture and feelings of individual, providing a primary need of citizen is essential for any country. ",No,Yes,6.5
Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Equality between men and women has always been an issue in societies all around the world. Some believe that universities ought to consent to equal numbers of male and female students in all subjects. However, I disagree on this issue that the capacity of each subject should be equal for men and women students due to the lack of practicality and fairness.

The first reason that the numbers of male and female students accepted by universities should not be equal in every subject is that it will definitely be impractical. since some subjects are not appropriate and also not popular for both genders, the opportunity for students of one gender in a specific subject might be eliminated. For an instance, some subjects such as nursing, clothes designing, and interior designing are more popular among female students whereas some other subjects such as civil engineering and mechanics are more desirable for male students. In addition, job opportunities may be influenced by this issue. If there was a shortage of male mechanics, some of the subject-related projects would not be carried out.

Another good reason for inequality in the numbers of male and female students in all university subjects can be the fact that it will not be fair. Some meritorious students may lose their chance to be accepted in the particular subject if the capacity of the course is divided equally, which is frustrating for students. So, I believe that the numbers of seats for each subject should not be based on the gender.

In conclusion, universities ought not to accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject due to being practical and fair. The capacity of each subject had better be based on merit not gender. ",No,Yes,6.5
"As most people spend a major of their adult life at work, job satisfaction is an important element of individual wellbeing. What factors contribute to job satisfaction? How realistic is the expectation of job satisfaction for all workers?","Undoubtedly, a full-time job has always been an integral part of most people’s lives. Since it is said that majority of the adult life is dedicated to working, job satisfaction is a significant element in people’s health and happiness. There are several factors which can lead to job satisfaction. However, I believe the expectation that all people can be satisfied with their working condition and get full enjoyment is unrealistic.

There are several factors which can result in job satisfaction. Firstly, workers’ interests might be influential in enjoying the work they carry out. In my opinion, the stronger interests people have in their job, the higher motivation they get to take on the work and do it properly. Another effective factor can be the sense of fulfillment workers feel after work completion and getting promotion. When they monitor their progress day by day, for example, they get motivated and it may lead to higher sense of responsibility they develop. Besides, they become good team players and can co-operate with others well. The last but not least, the amount of money people gain as the salary can play an important role in job satisfaction. When people get more money in a fulfilling job, they get encouraged to carry out their work with the sense of happiness and satisfaction.

Of course, all people in a society are not expected to enjoy their working conditions. Sometimes, the need for money forces people to find a permanent job regardless of their interests. For instance, due to the rising inflation in my country, people have to find a well-paid job or work overtime just for gaining money. They have to overwork, therefore, to make a living and there sometimes seems to be no balance between their work and life and they cannot spend their time with their family members and friends and enjoy their lives; which may lead to physical or mental health problems.

In conclusion, even though there are a lot of factors such as people’s interests, stimulating working conditions, and income which cause job satisfaction, it is unrealistic expectation that all workers are likely to be satisfied and content with their jobs. ",No,Yes,6.5
"Nowadays, protection of environment has been one of the critical issues for human being.","Nowadays, protection of environment has been one of the critical issues for human being. The protection of our future must be realised only with the ensurence of preservation of nature. However, environmetal problems ranges quite wide from pollution of air, water and soil to destruction of nature as deforestation and desertification. Therefore, some say that individuals has no influence over the solution of these issues and that government and large companies must be attributed. In my opinion, all of them, that is, individuals, government and large commercial companies are responsible in improving the environment. I will discuss this in this essay. First of all, the influence of individuals is not negligible. The cumulative, mass opinion must play important role over its government in policy desicion. The government would lagislate against air/water pollution or destrustion of nature which in turn does not allow commercial companies act against law. If individuals are not concerned of environment, government would allow companies' commercial activities without any sanction against destruction of nature. In 1960s when Japanese economy was thriving rapidly, a lot of companies developed its factories and manufactured its product ignoring environmental effect. In the result, some companies caused serious pollution which killed thousand of innocent people. Now there are strict regulations in Japan to prevent companies from causing serious environmental problems. To sum up, all these three factors; observation of citizens, rule of law, action of company are indispensable for the improvement of environment. If even one of them is missing other two would not fanction. ",No,Yes,6.5
Individuals can do nothing to improve the environment; only governments and large companies can make a difference.,"The responsibility of environmental conservation has sparked an intense discussion among the community. Some say that citizens could not pay any effort to help improve the situation while governments and big organisations can make a giant leap to alleviate the problem. In fact, we all should work collectively in different aspects of life to achieve the same goal. Individuals could be environmentally friendly and contribute in their daily lives. Recycling, replacing and reducing are great examples to demonstrate how we can play a part in protecting the planet. In our everyday lives, we can recycle papers, plastic containers, metal cans and so on. Besides, when we are doing shopping for groceries, books or clothes, we could always use reusable bags and buy goods with less unnecessary wrapping. With all these small actions, everyone in the society can make a change to conserve our natural environment. On the other hand, governments and large corporations could work on a higher level to enhance the environment. For example, many governments have imposed plastic bag levy to reduce its use and we can see some efficacy from this move. Also, companies could sell goods with less extra packaging and import fresh produces or goods from sustainable sources. Implementation of new laws by governments could make organisations do businesses in such a way that brings less harm to the planet. In conclusion, I disagree that only governments and huge corporations could make a change to preserve the natural environment. Instead, we should work and contribute together in both daily life, legislative changes and manufacturing processes to achieve environmental conservation. ",No,Yes,6
It is generally accepted that families are not as close as they used to be. Give some reasons why this change has happened and suggest how families could be brought closer together.,"Nowadays, people’s lifestyle has changed in comparison to the past and family members are not as close as they used to be for several reasons such as the economic issues and the growth of technology. Despite the fact that some would argue that this problem will correct itself overtime, in my view, there is much that can be done to address this problem constructively.

The first reason that families are far from each other these days can be the staggering costs of life which enforce almost all family members to work hard even overtime to provide money and amenities for the family. The rising inflation rate affects all parts of people’s lives and living expenses such as accommodation, either purchasing or renting, eating products, clothes, and other necessities. People, therefore, have to overwork and they cannot find free time spending with their family members in relief. Besides, by the growth of technology, most people tend to spend their time talking to their friends on social media or surfing the internet. So, this keeps people amused and away from their families.

One possible approach would be the government efforts and negotiations in order to hinder the day by day increase in prices; especially the price of dollar which has the significant and direct impact on people’s lives. This would certainly tackle the problem. However, measures like this would be considered as excessive and difficult to be done quickly. A more feasible approach would be time-management in using technology by family members. For instance, family members are to spend their time together after work rather than spending their time on social media or playing games on their gadgets.

In conclusion, it is true that this problem will probably not be solved quickly. However, that is not the reason to avoid taking actions. If the government and people take appropriate actions in this case, this problem will definitely be solved overtime and families could be brought closer together again, I suppose. ",No,Yes,6.5
Problem of weight increasing in few countries. What solution will be?,"The bodies of inhabitant in some states are deteriorating and their weight is also growing day by day. The main cause of this is diet habit and it will be solved by physical exercise.

We should maintain our daily food menu for maintaining sound health for the life of disease free persons. The inhabitants of developing country do not follow the rules of eating in the casual day. For example, they take all high rich fast food in the restaurants what they want due to having financial status. For this habit, many medical disorders also spread this modern word. We can not depend on mechanical instruments instead of ancient method in all diet rules

Physical movement is most important for every one in this modern age, because the people do not walk one metre too. For Instance, they have to do daily two time at least thirty minutes for the suitable heath. For example. they can do this by going to office or school running by-cycles not luxurious vehicles. We can train up our next generation from childhood for everyday playing so that they can aware of their valuable heath. In fact, we should not rely on the virtual world but we should maintain all in practical activities for our precious health.

In conclusion, the fat of the certain country can be removed by the daily practical labour and walking in short range of distances. I recommend, we should not purchase more cars for our ambitious future and the government should apply high tax rate in the price of innovative cars. ",No,No,6
What are the advantages and disadvantages of extracurricular activities for students?,"In recent years, school systems not only educate students, but also provide a large number of extracurricular activities, which can help students in developing their skills and abilities. However, while it is believed that taking part in such activities can be beneficial in a variety of ways, there are several potential drawbacks that need to be taken into account.

On the one hand, activities outside classroom environtment can bring certain advantages. Firstly, one of the main benefits of doing these activities is that you can improve your soft skills. Organized practical courses give students a chance to exercise and help teach communication skills, problem-solving skills, teamwork and collaboration, all of which are necessary during their grow up and prepare for their future jobs.

Secondly, attending extra activities also play an important role in promoting the mental health. These days, students become increasingly stressed because of overwhelming timetables in the compulsory curriculum. Therefore, students will be relieved pressure of study and feel full of energy when they spend their time on hobby and doing sports.

On the other hand, there are a considerable number of disadvantages. The first one is that being involved in extra curricular activities might be time management. As a result, students might have not enough time to complete their assignment, which fails to meet teachers’ requirements and poor study results.

Another problem is that students can lose their studying motivation in academic program. They may experience some physical difficulties when they participate in such activities. For instance, heavy sport trainings may lead to some health issues. Students who join a sport club may get extremely exhausted and cannot spare enough time for anything else, which effects on academic and creates an imbalance. ",No,Yes,6.5
The major issue of few country is increasing weight and how it can be solved.,"The bodies of inhabitant in some states are deteriorating and their weight is also growing day by day. The main cause of this is diet habit and it will be solved by physical exercise.

We should maintain our daily food menu for maintaining sound health for the life of disease free persons. The inhabitants of developing country do not follow the rules of eating in the casual day. For example, they take all high rich fast food in the restaurants what they want due to having financial status. For this habit, many medical disorders also spread this modern word. We can not depend on mechanical instruments instead of ancient method in all diet rules

Physical movement is most important for every one in this modern age, because the people do not walk one metre too. For Instance, they have to do daily two time at least thirty minutes for the suitable heath. For example. they can do this by going to office or school running by-cycles not luxurious vehicles. We can train up our next generation from childhood for everyday playing so that they can aware of their valuable heath. In fact, we should not rely on the virtual world but we should maintain all in practical activities for our precious health.

In conclusion, the fat of the certain country can be removed by the daily practical labour and walking in short range of distances. I recommend, we should not purchase more cars for our ambitious future and the government should apply high tax rate in the price of innovative cars. ",No,No,6
Some people say emotional health is better than physical health. To what extend do you agree,"The wellbeing of people has been since been argued that it is better to be emotionally fit than physical wellness. It is debatable over the years by some people that emotional health fit is of a better choice to physical. i strongly disagree with this essay and my reasons are, emotional wellbeing can mostly be achieved by a physical state of the body. Moreover physical fitness makes us not only emotional healthy but the fitness of the entire self. To begin with, emotional health is mostly achieved by the physical wellbeing. When the body is devoid of any health condition, it is fit and people are able to meet their targets in life. Just like a patient I saw last week in the consulting room who was a musician and very energetic but had an accident that led to surgery and resulted in amputation. Ever since he has been down with one sickness to the other. This ened up with depression and he is currently on antidepressants. Secondly, healthy body makes the other organs medically stable. The patient with one sickness ends up in the hospital and because it is just a low blood pressure he has become depressed, anxious leading to obsession. Example is a bstoke patient is happy and able to walk without support. To conclude, it is argued that emotional health is better than physical fitness and I strongly disagree due to the following two reasons, one needs to be physically stable to have a sound mind. also physical stability will enhance the general health of the person. The two health types in human are all needed and government is advised to encourage all these. ",No,No,5.5
"Compared to previous generations, an increasing number of people are traveling overseas for holidays. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?","In modern life, more people take trips overseas for pleasure compared to the past. This tendency is increasing all around the globe. The following paragraphs are going to explain the major advantages and disadvantages of the rising trend.

One of the clearest advantages here is that it gives people the opportunity to experience different cultures and customs, giving a broader perspective of the world. By visiting other countries, people become more understanding and tolerant of other cultures, and can learn to appreciate the cultural differences that exist. There are also benefits for the holiday itself, as many people tend to holiday in destinations that have better weather. For example, citizens of countries where the number of sunny hours is limited can rip benefit from abundance of sunshine in hot countries enriching their body with vitamin D.

However, there are disadvantages for the country, as citizens are spending their money overseas rather than in the domestic market. By taking holiday at home, people can not only economize in their budget but also play a role in the development of tourism in their own country. However, this is negated by the fact that although people leave their own country for a holiday, other people visit their country for the same reason. In New Zealand, for example, money spent overseas by people leaving the country is replaced by those who visit the country for their holiday.

To conclude, ubiquitous advances in technology have given the consumer more choice in overseas holidays. Although there are negative ramifications of people’s having their holidays in foreign countries, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. ",No,Yes,6.5
Underground is the most efficient mode of transportation,"Nowadays, underground is the most effective mode of transportation. l completely agree with this idea.

The reason why l hold view is that underground is cheaper and more affordable than other transports. That is because, nowadays, students use underground when they go to school, a lot of people use underground when they go to their work. In other words, people use less buses and automobiles. At a result, people use underground a lot.

My second reason is that underground is very fast. That is because people get to place early, when they go to commute. Underground goes one station for 3 minutes in Baku.

Taking everything into account, l agree that underground is the most useful mode of transportation. It affects a lot our life. ",No,Yes,6

One of the clearest advantages here is that it gives people the opportunity to improve their language skills, broaden outlook. By moving other countries, people become tolerant and more understanding of other cultures, can learn to appreciate the cultural differences. People learn new culture and regard it. There are also benefits for living in foreign countries, as some people tend to get higher education in other countries. For example, Azerbaijan people move to foreign countries for get higher education and make their career. However, there are disadvantages for people, as people who leave for other countries are missing their family and relatives. Also, people have language barrier and face difficulties when improve their language skills. People adapt to new environment and forget previous environment. This is negated by the fact that although people leave their own country for living, other people leave their country for the same reason.

There is no denying the fact that money plays a crucial role in our lives. Children are too young to...,"It is believed by most parents that teaching the importance of money to children at a young age is necessary. I completely agree with that view and will give my opinion in the following paragraphs.

On the one hand, most kids today often do not understand the value of money. This often comes from their families, some parents think that children are too young to understand about money, or some are too busy to teach them. Thus, children will tend to be wasteful, looking down on some things or some kind of people. For instance, most children immediately want a toy or food as soon as they see it and they throw angry if their desire is not fulfilled. They do not care if the parents have the resources to buy them what they want, in some cases when they are not met by their parents, it also leads to negative actions. It is necessary to teach they know how much hard work goes into earning each penny. Only then they would appreciate the things which they have.

On the other hand, children also need to be taught the wisdom of handling money. Therefore, they will not be deceived by bad intentions, nor will they suffer financial crisis in their adulthood. Families need to teach them how to save and manage money well. For example, parents should assign household chores to their children and reward them when finished. Hence, kids will respect what they do, work harder and try to save. Just like that, in the future they will become independent people and often wise against bad temptations.

To summarize, it is essential to teach children about the value of money from an early age. That brings so many good benefits to their future. ",No,No,6.5

"Some people prefer to take vacations in quiet, natural places, while others prefer to spend their vacation time in big cities. Compare and contrast these two types of vacation. Then indicate which you prefer and why","Some individuals would rather have holiday time in natural settings which is calm and peaceful whereas others tend to spend their break in an active place. There are two types of tourism that everyone wonders about were deciding to spend their time in. In my perspective, I would prefer to take vacation time in natural areas to make the most of my time. However, spending in natural places or in large cities has both several differences and some similarities and I will show up personal opinion in my own essay.

To begin with, the biggest difference between the two forms of tourism is price. As many of you already know, the expenses that happen in big cities are always on the high side when compared to within natural habitats. We spend a huge of money in working out our flights, accommodations, meals, and sightseeing within our budget while we can enjoy our holiday in rural areas with reasonable expenses and maybe half as low as another.

Another distinction between where we travel is the environment. From my personal experience, a dose of fresh air in natural areas is always better than in crowed cities, natural areas have not been influenced by industry and modernization, or have overpopulation, issues such as contaminated air, traffic congestion, and industrial waste are infrequent. On the other hand, the gas emission or the using fertilizers and herbicides of the chemical factories have impacted human life and tourists who are visiting these areas.

Besides the several differences, these two of types tourism have significant similarities in some aspects. Traveling in urban or in a place that belongs to nature is a form of entertainment, it enables each individual to release peer pressure after being hard-working and enjoy the quality of life. It provides broader our ideas and broadens our horizons and brings our optimistic view of precious life.

To sum up, when we compare and contrast about taking a holiday in natural places or in big cities, we can uncomplicated see differences and similarities about of them. Each form will have distinct qualities and we should take consideration to get the best suitable decision for ourselves, it must depend on each person’s hobby, demand, and situation. ",No,No,6
Smoking is injurious to health and its addiction and serious health reactions have increased into an alarming level in today’s world. I strongly agree to the opinion of its prohibition.,"Firstly, we all know that cigarettes and other tobacco products are very dangerous for all human beings. Even its manufacturers label on it that “cigarette smoking can kill you” or “it is not good for your health”. Likewise, once I saw a cigarette packet, it clearly had a label mentioning “smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer”. So even the manufactures are bound to inform his users that these are highly injurious to their health.

Secondly, in today’s world we are suffering from a pandemic caused by Coronavirus and other poor atmospheric issues i. e. smog. We have a lot of suffering going on because of these illnesses in our surroundings which is damaging our lungs so in any case cigarettes and other tobacco products will cause disastrous effects to one’s health. For instance, I had an uncle who was a chain smoker. We lost him in a pandemic because his lungs were already affected due to this bad habit. Sadly, his lung could not restrain the burden of Covid.

Although, all people know it’s killing effects but still its consumption is increasing, so to protect everyone's health the government should completely ban production of such products. However, the tobacco industry and its users will oppose this opinion but the government should appreciate them to cooperate and understand the long term benefits of human health. Government should appreciate the production of such alternative products which can be used instead of cigarettes and other tobacco stuff. For example tobacco flavor spray or chewing gum which can be used to fulfill your smoking desire without affecting your health.

In a nutshell, it is extremely beneficial for the public health if the government restricts the production of tobacco products. ",No,No,6.5

Furthermore, youngsters will be hanging their Christmas stockings in the hopes of receiving some nice presents from Santa Claus. Everyone goes to church after supper and prays to God, admitting their faults and afflictions, as well as their wishes for health and happiness. On Christmas Eve, many schools and businesses are closed so that family may spend time together.

Do you agree or disagree with a statement that people should only focus on developing their Strengths but not improving their Weaknesses?,"It is a common belief that people should only focus on establishing their strengths and not on improving their weaknesses.

However, I firmly believe that improving both the weak and the prosperity is extremely beneficial. Improve yourself to become the most perfect version.

On the one hand, you should focus on developing your strengths, to make them more confident. Developing strengths improves many aspects both physically and mentally. When we have developed ourselves, we will have more relationships, we will have more motivation in life. From there, we will have clear goals for ourselves and life will become more meaningful. A study from 2016 found when we focus on developing our strengths, we grow faster than when trying to improve our weaknesses.

On the other hand, weakness is what makes us feel fear so this is something we should develop. Improving our weaknesses helps us no longer feel shy but more confident anytime, anywhere. This weakness can also become your strength. But we need more time and effort to improve it and never give up to be able to develop more ourselves.

In short, many people have the opinion that only focusing on improving strengths. We should balance the time to develop both our weaknesses to make us more perfect and free from fear. ",No,Yes,6
Cultures around the world becoming more and more similar,"It is said that in today's globalized world cultures and traditions are indistinguishable to compare to last decades. This essay will discuss the main causes why people face to similarity are of influence wastern culture and give some possible development to this. To my mind, this have more negative outweigh positive.

First of all, in this day and age advertisement are ubiquitous and play pivotal role in promoting latest trend and fashion followed by some developed countries. Many developing cultures people trying to adapt to the modern culture whether what it is about food, clothes and music. Furthemore, in social media sites especially young generations have common interests about music and they may immatiate to their fans with a lot of ways such as they reply to dance on behind tiktok dancers, girls who like to follow follow models are tend to make up their face, change their styles to look like like a kind of puppet or some open clothes attract more and more young people that it is seen as an image of modernity Personally i believe that this does not conform to the custom of some eastern peoples or some individuals argue that distorts the behaviour of the people

Secondly, It is true that when people travel to abroad, it is comforting to use leisure amenities, people can eat in their favourite food no matter where this produced and listen some kind of music such as English music popular with everyone. Besides, this helps also economy of nation as international industry development and attracts more tourists.

"Nowadays, in some countries, people are spending long hours at the workplace? Why does this happen? Is this a negative or positive trend?","Nowadays, many people are overworked due to pressure from work and daily necessities. It is obvious that modernized life leads to an increasing cost of living, people have to work overtime to make ends meet. For example, parents need to work extra hours to earn more than their base salary to afford electricity bills, their children’s tuition fees, . . . . Especially since the Covid-19 pandemic, parents have to prepare computers or smartphones for their kids to study from home. In some other cases, many young people choose to work overtime with the desire to have opportunities for career advancement. The proof that an employee is willing to stay for another few hours at work can be perceived as a sign of one's serious commitment to the job. Employers usually look for people who are hard-working and long-term. So spending more time at work can lead to promotion prospects, higher salaries and career status.

However, overwork can present many problems, the most significant of which is that it can damage employees' health. When we spend too many hours on working, it is more likely that we cannot find time and energy left to take care of ourselves properly such as participating in outdoor activities, maintaining a balanced diet or getting enough sleep. As a result, overtime can cause stress, burnout, and depression. For example, Japan has the highest rate of suicide among workers, mostly men, in the world due to overwhelming work pressure. Besides, working long hours leaves them little time to spend with their friends and families. They are less likely to achieve work-life balance and will risk the well-being of their close relationships, exposing them to isolation in the future. ",No,No,6.5
The bar chart shows expenditure on companies,"The chart provides information about three car companies in the UK which are Acura, Chevrolet, and Cadillac spent on three types of advertising in 2007.

Overall. we can see that while Cadillac spent most of its money on advertising, the money for advertising in Acura was a little bit lower. It is noticeable that the spending of Acura and Chevrolet was nearly similar.

Regarding TV, Cadillac invested the most in it, with a vast majority (70 million dollars), followed by Chevrolet and Acura with 60 million dollars and 55 million dollars in turn. The gap between companies was not really a big difference, just about a tenth percent. This pattern can be seen again with the press, with 55 million dollars in Cadillac then 40 million dollars for Chevrolet. The spent on the press in Acura is slightly less than the other two companies, which is 39 million dollars.

These days it is much easier for many people to travel to different countries for tourism than in the past,"In the recent decades, there has been a significant increase in the number of opportunities for international tourism. In my opinion, with the growth in international tourism, people now have a greater awareness of other cultures than in the past, while the benefits of this trend can be outweighed by the drawbacks.

On the one hand, the main benefit that people derive from the international tourism when it becomes easy is that it improves global mindset of those, because travelling widely can give them the chance to enjoy such things as the art, customs and cuisine of different countries and to meet other people who have different cultural backgrounds. This makes them well-informed enough about every aspect of the life.

There are, however, far more drawbacks associated with the growth of international tourism. The first one is that if many more tourists visit a country, the culture and environment of that place are more likely to be damaged. For example, traditional crafts are replaced by the cheap trinkets, which may make them eventually disappear. Also, a greater number of tourists stay for only a short period of time, but they tend to litter the streets. Because of that, tourism is often considered as one of the key factors contributing to the pollution in some areas, where tourism industry is well developed.

Finally, although the hospitality industry can create employment for local people, it tends to be precarious because much of it is seasonal, with long periods of the year offering no work. As a result, most people having a job related to the tourism industry often need to look for work or even suffer from poverty in other seasons of the year when fewer visitors come.

In conclusion, there are some advantages of travel, but these do not compensate for the damage inflicted on the environment, culture and individuals by mass tourism.

The Effect of Heat Input of GTAW Process on the Microstructure of the Heat Affected Zone in AISI D2 tool steel,"AISI D2 is the most commonly used high-carbon and high-chromium cold-work tool steel. It has many attractive properties such as high wear resistance, high compressive strength, and high hardness after hardening which can be an advantage for a variety of industrial applications such as mill rolls, blanking dies, and punches. The steels of this group are considered as the most alloy steels [1]. Although these steels have the same chemical composition as stainless steels because of their high chromium contents they are prone to corrosion cause of the lower percentage of nickel than stainless steels[2]. Furthermore, they have higher hardness compared to stainless steel given their high percentage of carbon [1]. These steels are usually subject to heavy loads and abrasion. Surface defects because of wear, corrosion, and other degradation mechanisms will make these expensive tools leave the production cycle and impose heavy costs on industries. These steels obtain desirable abrasion properties from the presence of large values of carbon, chromium, and other alloying elements such as vanadium and molybdenum. however, the existence of these alloying elements in steel increases the hardness because of carbide formation that besides the advantages makes this steel weak in welding. The existence of large-scale cold cracks for these steels and the loss of dimensional accuracy are among the reported problems in welding parts made of this type of steel [3]. Preheating is necessary for welding these steels and it causes of reduces the thermal gradient between the weld zone and the heat affected zone, thereby reducing cracking, hardness and residual stresses in the HAZ are affected by reducing the cooling rate. Moreover, it prevents high heat shock due to welding [4]. Input heat is one of the most important welding parameters and the most effective element on the width and coarseness of the HAZ. Any change in this factor directly affects the HAZ. The input heat affects the grain growth in the area near the melting line. Moreover, the structure of the grains affects the strength, toughness, flexibility, and corrosion resistance of the alloy. Welding leads to internal stresses in the part that can be destructive and have adverse effects on the performance of the part. These internal stresses could result in warping, cracking (dimensional distortion), and even breaking of the part at stresses much lower than the stresses that the part is designed to withstand. PWHT increases the life of the part and its strength by eliminating or reducing internal stresses and reducing stiffness [5]. Thus, a correct understanding of the effects of input heat on the microstructure and properties of welded specimens is important. By observing the principles of heat treatment and performing pre-heating and post-heat at the proper temperature and welding with controlled heat and precise control of all welding parameters and variables, a good weld can be reached.

"Memorization of information by frequent repetition, namely Rote learning play a role in many education","There are three ingredients in the good life learning, earning and yearning. Some people believe that acquire knowledge through cramming is essential in a plethora of academies. But, others thought that meaningful understanding is crucial as compared with rote learning. Both arguments have their own pros and cons and I shall discuss my view points in upcoming paragraphs.

To begin with, first and foremost reason is that with the help of rote studying people can easily gain cognizance. Secondly, individuals can learn things through grasping such as pupils remember a script of play and recollect the mobile number. Finally, youngsters cram physics equations, mathematics formulas because it is illogical to study these type of definitions bye heart. Some juveniles use cramming to learn exams.

On the other hand, every garden has weeds. Firstly, teenagers never use rote learning for longer terms. Secondly, if children do not recall the things again and again then infants f forget whole material. Lastly, communities never utilize rote learning in some situations because when people cram all the data mixed in mind and people get confused.

Probing ahead with meaningful understanding, teenagers who understand the whole information they never forget in lifetime. Moreover, meaningful learning is a must if a person want to achieve something in life. In addition, education system prefer both ways of teaching.

To sum up, I would like to reiterate that due to the rote learning societies forget things if they never recall. However, meaningful knowledge is important because with these humans can use for long time. ",No,Yes,6
Individuals can do nothing to improve the environment; only governments and large companies can make a difference.,"Some people say that there is no need for any individual to help for the improvement of the environment because they believe that it only depends on the performance of the government and huge companies. I totally disagree to this idea. I believe that every individual is important through participating and encouraging awareness to all.

Everyone is essential. Any good plans for the betterment of the environment has to be started by an individual. The goal will only be achieve if every part of the community will participate. For example, the government had announce about the global warming prevention and tips on how to do it, they need the participation of every individual so that the goal may be accomplish, because if people will only hear about it without any action from them, the goal will not be met.

Also, any individual can be an instrument to encourage awareness to all that they will encounter. If anyone had been intentionally doing his/her part for the project, the outcome will be positive. One good example is being member of a family, let us say that the mother heard about the project of the government to save the earth by starting from segregating garbage in different ways which are garbage, recycling and compost. The mom can be a good encourager by first doing it by herself, then next is to teach her husband and kids to do it as well. This is a good contribution to the government's project that may lead to a positive outcome.

In conclusion, every individual is essential for the goal of improving the environment. If there is no individual involvement, success in achieving the goal is impossible. ",No,Yes,6.5
"The government cannot fund all research projects because its budget is limited; therefore, some people insist that only research pertaining to the field of science and technology should receive government funding.","The government cannot fund all research projects because its budget is limited; therefore, some people insist that only research pertaining to the field of science and technology should receive government funding. While I do admit that scientific research should receive maximum funding, I totally disagree with the argument that the government should stop funding research in less ‘useful’ fields like arts or history.

Scientific research certainly provides tremendous value because scientific innovations have the power to change our lives for good. Take, for instance, the invention of the antibiotic. This wonder drug saved the lives of millions of people and continues to be a major lifesaver even today. The computer is also the result of scientific research. This invention changed the way we work and store information. Today, it is impossible to imagine a world without computers. Other inventions like electricity, motor vehicles and home appliances have also revolutionized our lives.

However, just because scientific research provides more value it does not mean that research in other ‘less useful’ fields should be discouraged. Of course, archeological research or research into the origin of languages is unlikely to have a massive impact on our day-to-day life. Yet, this information is crucial for understanding how we reached where we are today. The truth is that there are still a lot of things we can learn from previous generations. These kinds of research may even lead us to a common ancestor and that might put an end to the hostility prevailing between many nations. Historical research also teaches us about mistakes we must not repeat. The World Wars and the Genocide are two examples. Research on these horrific incidents keeps reminding us about the extent of damage they caused. If future generations do not learn about them, they might be tempted to commit the same mistakes again.

To conclude, not only scientific research but research in other fields also provides great value. Therefore, the argument that only scientific research should receive government funding does not hold water. ",No,Yes,6.5
some field executive in large companies should receive high salaries while others think they are paid too much compared to ordinary workers discuss both views and give your own opinion,"It is often considered that, of late, multinational companies play an indispensable role in employees life. It has been providing a significant concern in all over the world. A sea change has been witnessed in the past few years. As per the stated notion, large firms should promotion their senior workers whereas others argue that, they paid high wages than ordinary workers.

To embark on, their are major concerns why organisation's paid too much salary to wage earner. First and foremost several workers have ample experience regarding job and skills which is considered having had a efficacious effect on both the individual and organisation. For instance, if he or she has a good quality of leadership and sustainable responsible it would develop a deeper understanding will stand their performance or ability. Thus, owner should reward to their senior member for enhancing inspiration.

On the other hand, it is generally believed that some companies give less salary to ordinary workers. on a wider spectrum, alot of English to education which would reap the benefits of globalisation, For instance if person do not have a capable of responsibility for effective work so executive do not paid too much salary. Hence, it is not a contributing factor.

"Traffic and housing problems could be solved by moving large companies, factories and their employees to the countryside. Do you agree or disagree?","Traffic in the cities had become a big issue because of the massive population similarly, because of the vast masses the accommodation becomes a dilemma so some people suggest that relocating large factories to the countryside with their employees will solve this problem. I agree with removing large factories in the urban area but people should be supported by transportation facility.

Big industries in the cites might create noise and pollution which depend on the type of production of the company rather than that it occupy the massive area and create traffic around the location due to their numerous worker might commute by their individual vehicles to travel to the company which unintentionally form a traffic jam, for instance, Pricol a multinational companey was creating huge traffic problems likewise occupied a large amount of land inside the city so few individuals filed a case against that company after few years with public prosecutor they common people win the case and judge demanded to shift the company with in 1 year after a year the traffic was reduced up to 80% around the location.

To continue, People are paying 50% of their salary to accommodation. The place becomes expensive because of a shortage of lands. If gigantic companies move outside of the urban, there will be a drastic change in the rent price that people can afford it. the company space must be use to construct an affordable apartment. in Mumbai, a huge fight is going on at the present for place call Dharve, which is a slum in the city many business tycoons tried to capture this place but the people inside the area are resilient and opposing every offers because future generation should live in an affordable place.

to sum up, traffic and accomodation can be solved by shifting massive factories and companies out side of the cites. employees commuting problem can be solved by providing a company transportation service such as a bus. ",No,Yes,6.5
Some people think it is a good thing for senior managers to have much higher salaries than the other workers in a company. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"There is a statement that the position of senior managers is much more profitable in comparison to other workers and there is nothing wrong with it. In this essay the topic of an existed gap between salaries of different workers will be discussed.

Getting a higher position is a task that requires considerable efforts, because employers pay attention to education and professional qualification of an employees. That is why advantange in salary seems to be completly logical in this case. For example, people who have graduated from a prestige university have spend a lot of time over the course of their studing. Therefore, they obtain some competence that will allow them to perform better in professional activities and as a consequence, they deserve more material gain because the company derive more profit from their work.

However, there is another issue that also should be taken into consideration. Team working is not limited by formal accomplishing your task and relationships between team members are also bear a great importance. If a difference between salaries is too enormous, most workers will be claim that company underestimate their contribution in the work process and their work should be paid better. Their discontent may have a detrimental affect to the productivity of a whole work team.

In conclusion, I would like to express my opinion regarding this topic. I state that there is should be a difference between slary of the senior managers and other workers, but it should not be absurdly tremendous in order to keep motivated all workers of the company. ",No,Yes,6.5
"nowadays many people choose to be self-employed, rather than to work for a company or oganisation.why might this be the case?what could be the disadvantages of being self-employed?","One of aspirations of university graduated is getting outcome from the subject that they have studied for long years which can be an award for their hard attempts. It can be concluded of either stablish a carrier by yourself or hiring in other's office that euthustatics of first view are increasing contemporary. This essay will mention some reason of this elected and their obstacles. First positive point of having your own business is freedom of operation. it means tat, there is no force for yourself to behave based on others orders. the first and foremost character to lay down roles is yourself. As a boss, it is your turn to not only selecting aims and objections but also applause your employments by creating friendly while respectful atmosphere in order to generally progress. Having chance to be more innovation is another reason. Take a architecture company for instance. there are many bridges and routes all over the world that had builded as same as each others, however most of this compony are following permenant steps. Creating new approach of sight to solve relentless problems, promoting you much more than others in this professional competition. In contrast, the difficulties of leading a compony such as captain of a ship has a lot of uneasy situations that make your mind buzzing all day everyday, still you are in vacation or on family weekend. In other word, it can discreetly impact on your both social and private communication which can lead to broken home. Furthermore, if you cannot affording your payments while you are working hard, many of your staffs will be unemployed. to sum up, although the benefits of being your own boss cannot be limited into some cases, there are many obstacles, too.

These days majority of individuals decide to start their own business instead of working for a company or organization.,"These days majority of individuals decide to start their own business instead of working for a company or organization. There might be some reasons to being self-employed and also negative consequences of it.

The main causes that I believe why many people choose to run their own business rather than to work for other companies are that they want to have flexible working hours or because of modern technologies that provide an opportunity to work at their own. Firstly, many people in all likelihood prefer to be independent so that they can plan their working schedule how it is suitable for them and not to follow the rules that set by companies which probably will offer a chance to keep work-life balance as a lot of people find difficult to manage it working long hours in other organizations or companies. Secondly, thanks to state-of-the-art technologies human beings can work privately and establish their own business. For example, nowadays IT specialists may obviously leave the company that they work and do their job at home or in their office by advertising their work on the social media and get clients as well as earn even more money.

While there are decided reasons mentioned above, launching own business could be disadvantageous. To begin with, lack of experience and knowledge of some youngsters in the spare of running their own business can lead to difficulties in terms of solving problems and considering the wider implications of their actions. As a result, it is possible that they will go bankrupt and be in terrible predicament. Moreover, many companies provide health insurance and guarantee pension and other benefits but self-employed people should maintain these themselves which are not cheap and might also bring problems to them.

In conclusion, although flexibility in a work place and advanced technologies could be considered as contributors to this recent work shifting trend, it can also have negative impact on people’s business especially for young ones. ",No,Yes,6.5
is job salary more important than job satisfaction?,"It is used to be considered that passion to job is not that crucial as huge donation for it. I fully agree with these thoughts and totally understand that job salary is much more privilege than job satisfaction.

First, I truly believe that high salary could bring more successful and safe opportunities to the bright and future than job that I am into. Moreover, I could say that gainful job give much better work promoting. It’s more common variant that person who is working on successful work will live happier life full of things that she or he always wanted to try. On top of that, I hardly believe that huge salary means open doors into carefree and confident life. For instance, well-known businessman and businesswoman’s also chose high income that was predicted from the extreme beginning. Furthermore, in 2017 was made an anonymous psychological vote, which showed that such kind of personalities live their best lives without regret.

Overall, if job brings money you will have the brightest life and bigger basis under your legs.

Secondly, I’m really into thoughts that it doesn’t matter which kind of job are you doing if you have good wage. You could be marketing manager or programmer, doctor or lawyer, it doesn’t play a huge role if you are competent, and for your work you gain high salary. Even if you don’t get enormous pleasure from your job you always can visit courses and a number of lessons that you are really into. Another point is that you will pay for these lessons from your non loved work, but which gives you much more abilities. As it was shown by huge amount of people that kind of work is not that bad like everybody supposes.

Generally, you don’t need to love your profession, on the contrary you should be a good worker as well as for it, you actually gain your money.

In other words, I strongly agree and believe that income job brings more safe and successful future than job with real satisfaction. ",No,Yes,6.5
People prefer to do business rather than working in an organisation,"In this present time people generally focuses to set up a new business rather than being employed under any employer in any firm.

There are many individuals who usually prefers to work freely by setting up a business. For example- A person can start a business on his own as it will give him satisfaction to work whenever he feels like and even the income is on daily basis so an individual need not to wait for a whole month to receive his salary. Individuals can use his innovative ideas, plan and take decesion for his business.

However there are people who still prefers to work under someone for guidance. For instance a candidate joins a firm to understand a work place, gain knowledge and experience so that he/she can always reach to a higher level and even there are various opportunities such as employees provident fund, health insurance policy, travelling tour packages etc allowances are also provided in an organisation.

One can always be self- employed for his/ her wish but one may not get all the benefits which an employee might receive to work in any firm or company. The business may need some investment and even can occur loss in the initial stage of the business. ",No,Yes,6.5
The reading and the lecture are about the reasons why north american companies will adopt or not a n ecocertified in order to follow the path of other international companies,"The reading and the lecture are about the reasons why north american companies will adopt or not a n ecocertified in order to follow the path of other international companies. While the author of the reading states that american companies will not follow the same path than international ones did, the lecture affirmed that american companies will adopt the certification, thus contradicting the lecture and giving three reasons.

First of all, according to the reading american consumers are exposed to so much advertising, hence the benefit of publishing in product´s labels that your product is ecofriendly would not be perceived by americans. However the lecture disputes this point by indicating that americans do not give the same attention to every kind of publicity so that americans will value those advertising.

Furthermore, the reading argues that americans prefer price and the certification will increse the final price of good, but the lecture contradicts this statement affirming that when the difference in price is less than 5%, consumers look for ther difference, such as environmental care.

Finally the text says that american companies do not have to be worried about international ones, since they sell all their products in America; however the audio affirms that international companies will entry to America if consumers do not find the kind of products that consumers look for, which are ecofriendly products.

In short, although the reading and teh lecture are about the same topic, the three reasons given by the passage are effectivly challenged by the lecture. ",No,Yes,6.5
Big salary is much more important than job.To what extent you agree?,"While searching for employment, there are myriad of factorsthat are kept in mind like job satisfaction, monthly incomeand working environment. However, it is opined that earninghuge amount of money is extremely imperative instead ofhaving satisfaction at a workplace. Although money plays acrucial role in survival, I do not completely agree withaforementioned view and I will explain why in this essay.

Certainly, there are number of argument in favor ofimportance of salary at firm. The preponderant is the income plays a significant role in fulfilling basicnecessities of life and if someone has higher income, thenthey should easily accomplish their dreams of luxurious lifeThese Days such type of lifestyle gives people opportunityto showcase their status in society. In spite of the luxuriouslife, higher salary frequently insures better future for the familyfor instance, there are number of parents who are merelyworking for long hours to earn huge amount of money, andthey invest that money in providing better education andlifestyle to their children.

Despite the fact that manly provide bright future andbetter life, the idea that at firmbig salary is more pivotal than job satisfaction is completely preposterous. The person who is only working for money, often became victim of the stress whereas the person working by ones will occasionally tired at workplace. These are those people who choose their field by themselves, as a result they are more creative and always try their best for achieving good results for the company. To cite an example. Sundhar Pichai the CEO of the renowned companyGoogle achieves this level of success owing to the fact that he is satisfied: with his feild, and he always states follow your heart, and it isthe only path to success. Therefore, satisfaction of employer is much more crucial as compared to salary. Owing to the fact that it leads to prosperous and successful life.

To conclude, it is definitely a case that essential for better life but to accomplish happiness satisfaction and interest is required. Personally, I believe the working condition that satisfies the mind of a person iscertainly more vital. ",No,Yes,6.5
"To succeed in a business, one needs to know maths. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","In recent years, some people believe that maths play a more crucial role in business. In my opinion, I think that maths si significant in business, however people need other elements to succeed.

On the one hand, there are various why that maths is necessary in business. To begin with, some businessment need mathematic to complete in their workforce. Because of the fact that business should handle lots of data, so we can not deny the need of mathematics. Futhermore, the costs in the comany also need math to resolve such as pay for workers. Secondly, people need to ensure can operate in business and produce enough cask to invest into sell. For example, people must charge enough for their product.

On the other hand, I think that in business, people need more skills, Firstly communication skills with the customers. For example, whene people meet thein customer, they require the flexible communication skill to solve some problems in their work. Futhermore, if the workers have a great communication skill, they can attract a huge amount of customers for their company. Secondly, languages skill is more and more important. In modern globalization, almost of companies want develop their company and co-oprate with some foreign company to bring more income. For this reason, the employee need know more language when they want to work in big companies. ",No,Yes,6
In some countries it is illegal for companies to reject job applicants for their age Is it positive or negative to the development,"Many countries have a maximum age limit prescribed for hiring in a specific job. However, the topic is being hotly debated whether it is wrong to reject a prospective employee on the basis of their age. I think it is a positive as well as a negative development.

On the one hand, it is acceptable not to hire an employee after attaining a specific age. There are ample reasons why companies refrain from an employee who is beyond a specific age due to scientific factors. There are some scientific theories which claim that it is difficult for a human mind to process or store information after attaining a specific age. As such many companies prefer having someone younger to take over a specific role because it is easier to train them and are more open to new challenges. Thus, it is a gamble to go after an old person.

On the other hand, many organizations prefer someone who has a considerable experience in a specific area to cater to the needs of the organization. There are many benefits of having an elder employee than their younger counterparts as with age comes experience. Furthermore, they can utilize their learning and implement their mind in a better manner. Moreover, one should not be discrimination against anyone on any basis. There may be certain areas where the age and exposure plays a pivotal role and in no manner can be substituted.

In conclusion, there should be no bias towards the person on the basis of age. One should take into consideration the pros and cons of hiring a person for a specific post and also consider that age is just a number and many time the experience is important. ",No,Yes,6.5
smoking and alcohol consumption are injurious to health then why does the business of tambaku and liquor still continue?,"Undoubtedly, cigarettes and alcoholic drinks has been impacting on our health due to the consumption of others. As we know these hamper not only mankind, but also environment. Thus, by viewing this, masses arise questions, like if these substances were so harmful then why this would not be banned. In the following paragraphs, I will explore the reasons behind the consumption and why these items are still sell in market.

On the one hand, people are taking these drugs due to addiction and for their happiness. First and foremost, folks think, especially youngsters, they look smart by taking liquid and tobacco. It is certainly true that these are the stress buster buster activities and people often forget their worries and tensions by having this. But when individual were consume more drugs, it would lead to accident and manifold health present problems, such as brain Tumor, cancer and many more and after a while one person addicted towards these activities.

On the other hand, social acceptance and provide employment to citizens are the significant reasons of continuing this field. Primary, banning on strong drinks and on nicotine are impossible, because junk food also impact negatively on mankind's body. But an authority could not Ban fast food as folks love to take this food. Just like junk meal these drugs are also the individual's own choice. Having know their dangerous results masses socially accepted these items. Apart from that, the companies who are making these items has been imparting jobs to manifold labours, which improve the quality of society. Therefore job opportunities and welcoming nature of society towards tobacco and alcohol, thereby still continue the business.

In conclusion, although it is individual option, but it impacts on others health also. Thus, I believe that it should be prohibited in public places. ",No,Yes,6.5
"In some countries, celebrities earn higher salaries than senior politicians. What are the reasons? Is it a negative or positive development?","In the contemparory era, a number of countries, politicians earn less income than celebraties. In this essay, I will discuss the reasons why this is happening and tell if it is a positive or a negative enlargement.

There are several reasons for this. The main one is that society give more respect to celebrities than politicians. Moreover, they are the entertainer of our socity. Therefore, people like to listen and watch them more than politicians for example, Kapli sharma show and narender modi lecture, people will prefer to watch Kapil Sharma shown rather than narendra modi lecture because they will enjoy watching him.

In addition to this, I feel that it is a negative enlargement because politicians are the developer of our nation and our next generations future is in their hands. They will construct education centers. Therefore, government should pay more salary to politicians than celebs.

By the way of conclusion, I would say that allthought the celebrities entertain the society. However, politicians help to construct the future of our childer. All in all, I believe that it is a negative evolution. ",No,Yes,6
Directors of large companies often receive much bigger salary increases than ordinary workers. Employers’ organisations say that in a global market this is necessary to attract the best management talent. What are your views?,"In the past few years, the corporate sector has witnessed immense growth globally. This progress has created several job opportunities for professionals in various fields at all levels. When it comes to salaries, we often see a huge difference between the earnings of the ordinary employees and top managers. Senior managers usually draw massive salaries whereas the junior and middle level workers are paid just average amounts.

In my viewpoint, I would agree with the statement that directors should be paid more as compared to their subordinates. Firstly, their job responsibilities, working skills and problem-solving attitude are significantly different from that of the other employees of the organization. Secondly, executive directors and managers are accountable for the profits and losses of their companies. They have a tight schedule as they have to fulfill their responsibilities within the given duration. Considering all these factors, I think that the senior managers deserve a higher payroll.

Moreover, an attractive salary acts as a motivation for the workers as they will also work harder to reach the top position. Therefore, companies can use this factor for inculcating a sense of healthy competition among employees. It also helps in getting the best out of them.

To conclude, we can say that it is vital for companies to provide impressive salary hikes to their directors. This practice motivates the staff to work diligently for reaching higher positions in the organization. ",No,Yes,6.5
The bar chart shows expenditure on companies,"The chart provides information about three car companies in the UK which are Acura, Chevrolet, and Cadillac spent on three types of advertising in 2007.

Overall. we can see that while Cadillac spent most of its money on advertising, the money for advertising in Acura was a little bit lower. It is noticeable that the spending of Acura and Chevrolet was nearly similar.

Regarding TV, Cadillac invested the most in it, with a vast majority (70 million dollars), followed by Chevrolet and Acura with 60 million dollars and 55 million dollars in turn. The gap between companies was not really a big difference, just about a tenth percent. This pattern can be seen again with the press, with 55 million dollars in Cadillac then 40 million dollars for Chevrolet. The spent on the press in Acura is slightly less than the other two companies, which is 39 million dollars.

The different other about Cinema, while in press and TV, Acura and Chevrolet were much less than Cadilac, being four times as much as the money. ",No,Yes,6.5
Business culture in globalization impact on an international business with operations in different countries.,"Over the last three decades, a fundamental shift has been occurring in the world economy. We are moving toward a world in which barriers to cross-border trade and investment are declining; perceived distance is shrinking due to advances in transportation and telecommunications technology; material culture is starting to look similar the world over, and national economies are merging into an interdependent, integrated global economic system. The process by which this is occurring is commonly referred to as globalization.

Globalization has resulted in greater cross-national business and cultural interactions. This also means the business culture has considerable importance for an international business with operations in different countries. When you’re dealing with people from another culture, you may find that their business practices, communication, and management styles are different from those to which you are accustomed. Understanding the culture of the people with whom you are dealing is important to successful business interactions and to accomplishing business objectives.

Occasionally business culture will affect your ability to enter an international market, develop and maintain business relationships, negotiate successful deals, conduct sales, conduct marketing, advertising campaigns, engage in manufacturing, and distribution.

In conclusion, we need to understand the point of view of people who worry about cultural globalization because it is a threat to national traditions. However, this is outweighed by its positive impact on international understanding and the fact that it represents progress within a society. ",No,Yes,6.5
"other believe doing uz the job is beneficial for individuals, company and society. Discuss both view","Nowadays, trend ofjob hopping has been increased. It is believed by a plethora of people that no one can continue job forever, whereas other individuals argue that to be in same job is advantageous for person; however, in my opinion if human feels growth or satisfaction it's beneficial to be in the workplace. This essay will discuss both of aforementioned view.

To commence with, few people argue to be in same profession or career. If someoneis following the same profession or a job, then it will be easier to attain perfection in his field. This has resulted, benefit not only to person but also to community and firm. To explicate it, professional and experienced creature will be more successful in the field along with, it gave profit to company. Besides this, changing frequent workplace will drastically affect the human being to settle in new environment and deal with new people. This may leads to frustration even provide stress. So, it is beneficial for all to have consistency in career. The more time you be in business, the easier it becomes to attain perfection.

On the other hand, why nobody should continue same job forever? . The reason behind this is fixed job will bound your limits the field. Change in employment will increase the money, but, also the gain knowledge. Though if, one had changed placement, the changein environment would have given more exposure and challenges. Which can increase productivity. For example, the research conducted by Harvard University in 2015 that 70% of people is glad to change their employment. Owing to the fact that, it gives them new experiences and got increased salary. Thus, changing job will benefit society and industry to have satisfied and trained employees.

In conclusion, although consistency in job will provide perfection, but changing workplace more gave more exposure and experience. In my opinion, if individual is satisfiedand having constant growth then it favors to be in same job. ",No,Yes,6.5
Do the advantages of family-run business outweigh its disadvantages?,"In modern life many prefer working for private sectors like family- run business to being employed by public ones. In this essay I am going to discuss both sides of this argument and then my perspective will be drawn.

On the one hand, family- run business brings adolescents a significant fundamental for them to absorb and accumulate knowledge. Furthermore, it is easy to seize the opportunity to expand their employment prospects. For instance, a well-known chain of Pho ha noi or chain of Vietnamese bread now operated by the next generation. As a result, they do not have to worry about their career because they have their own path and could cover their basic living expenses.

On the other hand, there are two main demerits about family-run business. First of all, it can cause disharmony between the older generation and younger generation. Because of being self-oriented, teenagers may want to develop their own career path not dependent on their parents or they have their own ambition so they do not want to follow their family footsteps. Furthermore, one-man businesses are more hazardous than state-owned companies. As the former investment stems from their interest or a bank loan but the latter has investment from public or other resources, consequences if a company bankrupted, private enterprise have to pay a vast loan or have huge deficit.

In conclusion, a family-run business is a good way to earn money but entrepreneurs should weigh up its pros and cons before starting up. ",No,No,6
Advantages of running a business with one’s own family members.,"There are several reasons why running a business with one’s own family members is advantageous. One of them is a strong sense of unity. It is instinctive that all family members demonstrate, share core values to the firm and go along well with each other. That is why they often have a tendency to work hard together to reach the stated goals and make their privately held family firm more successful. Secondly, family-controlled firms are often associated with greater stability in terms of employment, regardless of the economic cycle. The family members share a level of persistent commitment and engagement to the company. A family-run business also is less likely to fire employees during economic downturns. Hence, it can be assumed that family firms generally tend to keep employment levels stable and avoid downsizing. Last but not least, another advantage is decreasing cost and expenditures. Because of their blood relationship, these company members may be more willing to make financial sacrifices for the sake of the business. For instance, they may be enthusiastic about offering their wages to protect their socioemotional wealth. Briefly stated, these advantages can create an extra sense of purpose and a competitive edge for the business. ",No,Yes,6.5
"What are the impacts of remote working on other businesses (coffee shops, hotels etc)?","Nowadays, the Internet and the ways of earning money on it are very well developed. Many employers of large firms offer work at home. It's very cool and comfortable for people, as well as safe during a pandemic.

However, working from home brings a blow to cafes, hotels and other places where people used to work offline often. We can say that such institutions have started to have a loss in the last 5 years, because there was a pandemic and the Internet began to grow at a tremendous speed and vacancies on it too. Previously, many people did interviews in cafes, went on business trips and stayed overnight in hotels, and now more and more people are choosing remote work.

I believe that in this case, institutions also need to reach a higher level, (не очень поняла смысл) because we live in the 21st century and we need to create more innovations. ",No,No,6
The majority of business owners are driven solely by the pursuit of wealth.,"An intriguing topic of discussion at hand is whether the majority of business owners are driven solely by gaining wealth. It may seem true that most business owners are driven only by the desire for money; however, as it is contemplated in depth, there appears to be too much absurdity to argue that the aforementioned statement is true. Although some people hold different perspectives and opinions, I personally oppose the idea that wealth is the only goal for the majority of business owners on account of two reasons: they give money away in the form of charitable donations and many business owners have a broader view of success than simple financial gain.

To start with, it is fairly common for business owners to give large sums of money to charity. This generosity on the part of many business owners shows that they care about not only money but also the welfare of others. If they just wanted to make more and more money, they would keep it or invest all of their earnings in profitable enterprises. Take Bill Gates and Warren Buffet, for instance. Both these men have made enormous contributions to charity. In fact, Warren Buffet made the single biggest charitable donation in history. In addition, Bill Gates has given more than 28 billion dollars to his own charitable foundation, which works to reduce poverty and enhance health care worldwide.

Furthermore, many business owners are driven by a desire to be successful in a more comprehensive way. Many successful business owners are more concerned with their reputation and public perception than with profits. A recent survey of one hundred executives revealed some interesting results. When asked why they went into business in the first place, 67 percent of those surveyed responded that they wanted to achieve wide-ranging success, not just make money. That is why many business owners regard their reputation among their peers in the industry as more important than profits. Moreover, creating a positive brand image in consumers’ minds comes before money making for most business owners.

In conclusion, although whether the desire of wealth led the majority of business owners is open to interpretation, it seems reasonable to claim that business owners are not entirely motivated by the desire to become rich because of two reasons discussed in this essay. ",No,Yes,6.5
Benefits and drawbacks of setting up and owning a company,"Many people choose to be self-employed, while others choose to be entrepreneurs. Setting up and maintaining a business is an excellent option for those who wish to be self-sufficient, but it has both advantages and disadvantages.

They are their own boss as a business owner, setting their own work hours and working autonomously. Furthermore, entrepreneurs may make their own decisions without influence from others, which makes them responsible. Building a new firm that is successful offers business owners with a great deal of personal fulfillment. It enables individuals to progress beyond a certain skill set and develop business and leadership abilities that will give them with ongoing personal growth, pride, and joy. These are ideal for people who have a natural talent for business.

On the other hand, starting a firm on one's own has a number of drawbacks. For starters, one of the most significant dangers of running a business is losing money. This means that the entrepreneur may have to go into debt or commit significant personal cash to start the business. Second, company owners are prone to high levels of stress as well as health problems. When an entrepreneur becomes overtired and stressed, he or she might damage their business by giving the impression that things are horrible and the company is about to fail. Furthermore, the more money people make, the more responsibilities they take on.

To summarize, those who operate their own businesses successfully must be self-assured, strong, and patient. They must know exactly what they want and be willing to devote all of their spare time to it, as well as face the obstacles. ",No,Yes,6.5
"Over the last two or three decades, the way that business is done has changed dramatically due to major advances in technology. As a result, a growing number of people are now choosing to work from the comfort of their own home. However, is the development positive, or are there more drawbacks than advantages?","The advancement in technology had made our life more easier in various aspects. In today's world, business can also be done from home as a result, numerous pupil choose to work from their own home. Despite of its positive development there are also some drawbacks of it. In this essay, I will explore both the pros and cons of working from home and try to draw some conclusions.

On the one hand, there are some advantages of working from home such as it helps us to save money, time and it will be easy for disabled people to work from home. Most of the individual have to go their office through vehicle either by bus or bike which may takes a lot of time. Firstly, By working through home it helps them to save their time and even to save money which is spent on transportation expenses. Secondly, For the handicap people who are permanently injured it makes them comfortable to perform their task in their own home. For instance, the disable individual who feel uncomfortable to work in office can perform their task with confident at their home.

On the other hand, I think that there are also several disadvantages such as less communication with staff and not being able to get knowledge from their seniors. If all the staffs work together at office then they will share their ideas and views with each other about the task and they will gain more information and method from one another. Furthermore, By looking at the performance of their senior staffs they can improve their ability to work. So, If the people work from home then they have to rely on their own ideas, they cannot learn from their seniors and they cannot see their friends performance.

To conclude, It seems to me that the drawbacks of working at their own home are more than its advantage as it is more important to learn new ideas and concepts with will automatically helps for future. ",No,No,6
"Today people often buy what they need and want via online. From your experience, what are the advantages and disadvantages for both individuals and companies to shop online?","In this era of information technology, technological advances have brought revolutions upon revolutions in this technological world. People can do a lot of things online, online shopping is one of the major products of these revolutions. Besides, both individuals and companies have their own ups and downs with online shopping. In my experience, here are some examples of the advantages and disadvantages for both individuals and companies to shop online.

First and foremost, the most prominent advantages that the companies enjoy with online shopping is the decrease in expenses. Companies do not have to invest in some places such as, staffs’ office, rental fees, maintenance and many more. With online shopping, companies now only have to own large enough warehouses for stock. Those transportation fees will also be paid by the consumers. Companies just have to make sure that the items which are sold for the consumers are in a good condition.

From the consumers’ point of view, the most important reason is the convenience. Online shopping will be very useful for the people who are really busy in working. They can do shopping anywhere online or from their comfort of their home. The consumers are able to do shopping when they are free. Also, they do not need to rush to the place and just buy an item that they need. The shoppers just have to pay for the transportation fees and the items are able to reach your home. Ultimately, the transportation costs may be even less compared with the costs of travelling by the consumers’ car.

On the other end of the spectrum, online shopping might have its own challenges for companies to overcome. There will be many customers which were in different countries. Sometimes, companies might have a lot of work in the process of allocating the parcels to the right country and place. Furthermore, some new companies will have some challenges to handle the good condition of the items as they are new. Scams pose the bad comments and affect the companies’ reputation. For the new and small companies, they can’t handle until it finally collapses as no costumers will take a risk to buy an item by seeing the bad comments.

In the eyes of consumer, there are some cons in online shopping. Sometimes, consumers might receive bad condition items. With online shopping, shoppers just look at the pictures of the products, they can’t feel the quality of the products. The items might be spoilt as being damaged in the process of transportation or the quality is not that good as consumers can’t check via online.

To recapitulate, online shopping is the best choice for those who are busy at work, but buying in the shop and checking the quality of the products will be better. However, online shopping is also significant, as we can see now, in the times of pandemic, online shopping becomes a major platform that keeps the economy from collapsing. Also, online shopping is being improved and made safer for everyone. ",No,Yes,6.5

In many cultures, sharing is always considered as a good manner, especially coming down to valuable things, such as practical skills, thoughtful knowledge, and rare resources. Information is one of the most precious resources in the modern world, as the more information people gather the more possible they can get success. Once getting shared information, researchers can discuss together, businessmen can make more accurate decision, and students can absorb more knowledge. After they gain benefits from the shared information, they can produce more outputs, which may contain new type of information worth sharing. Overall, this is a sharing circle that can move forward constantly.

On the other hand, some people believe that some Information is too important to be shared easily, because some significant information sometimes means a lot to some individuals or bodies. For profit-seeking companies, core information in businesses fields is as important as hearts to human beings. Once precious business secrets of a company spread out, the company may not be unique in the market, resulting in adverse effects to the company and staff in it. For those people who devote to research or economic areas, they can not ensure whether their precious information like latest discovery or experiment data can be used in a appropriate way. Their outputs may be taken as granted, or even worth, be copied, the researchers or students may lose their chance to be successful and get honors.

In my opinion, sharing should be encouraged, although there should be measures to ensure rights of handsome individuals or bodies. An atmosphere of sharing helps people get inspired from each other, as well as groups cooperate together, leading to win-win situations. Meanwhile. If appropriate measures, for example, laws of copyrights, can be taken, sharing information would be a lower risk option, with which more people and bodies would be more generous in sharing.

In conclusion, sharing information should be encouraged, although when coming down to crucial information, individuals and bodies should be careful whether there are measures that can protect their copyrights. ",No,Yes,6.5

A gossip culture pervades most companies. Employees like to talk about their bosses or other employees. Is there any advantage to this? What do you think are the disadvantages?,"Gossip is a dominant culture in the corporate world. In many circles, gossip is considered as a tool to gather information and build intimacy among colleagues, while others seem it as harmful phenomenon that that destroys trust and assails credibility. In the instance, I am of the honest opinion that gossip is the one of the major adversaries of a healthy corporate culture. In following essay i will discuss both merits and dimerits of gossip culture.

To commence with, there is several reasons which can support th benefits of gossip culture. Gossip, in fact, is nothing but implies office politics. It will be difficult for bosses of big companies to find out about the rumors in the company without gossiping. As a result, the company goes bankrupt. Secondly, not only does gossip harms the intended person, but also everyone in the organization with the help of gossip, the campaign grows faster and its revenue increases dramatically. Thus, gossip spreads quickly among people

On the other hand, big company executives suffer from gossip. To give an illustration of what I mean, to head of company or the employees in company may become unemployed. Also, through gossip company employees commit crimes because this is a case against the law. For instance, coca-cola workers were caught trying to sell company secrets.

To recapitulate, gossip strengthens trust and intimacy but on the contrary creates disagreements between people",No,Yes,6.5
"Nowadays, employees in various companies have recieved a high salary and that have difference views government should introduce a maximum wage for staff.

While in some ways it may seem reasonable to allow people to earn as much as compnies willing to pay. I personally claim that employee should be capped at a certain level. There are a numerous reasons why it is benifical to allow people to be paid extremely high salary. If companies want to attrack the talented people to work for them in their fields, they will offer extremely pay pakage for the talent. For instance, technology companies like Google are able to employ the best progammers because they have the massive package. Furthermore, people are paid high salary they are likely to be more movtivated and work hard in other to drive their business sucessfully. In fact, this, it means creating a stable economic development and rising tax revenues, it is good for both companies and employees. However, i agree wwith government should have a law about limit on earning. By using the power of government that will mitigate the gap between bosses and low staffs in business. The difference between normal salaries and top salaries is huge that makes people who are woking hard will be demotivated and feel unfair. With lower wage of excutive staffs, it might become feasible to introduce higher minimum wages for normal ones. On better consequence of that will decrease poverty and crime rates in city so that people could experience an improvement standard of living.

What are advantages and disadvantages of tourism for individual business owners?,"Nowadays, the tourist trade is a valuable source of income for many countries. Some people think that increased demand from tourists boost local economies as well as local businesses. However, there are both pros and cons of tourism for individual business owners. Firstly, tourism has a great role to play in a greater number of developing businesses than ever before and different agencies are progressively becoming involved in this sector. As, with the development of tourism, business companies have golden opportunities to offer service or sell products. If the company can create a good image beforehand, it will be appreciated by tourists and begin to catch more people's attention. It will be good for the fate of the company in the future. Secondly, small companies which are in poor condition and face financial problems can survive. There is a great need for business opportunities in tourism related services such as accommodation, local agriculture, manufacturing and construction of hotels. In this way, small companies can earn a lot of money for improving their financial conditions and enhancing the performance by applying large-scale projects. On the other hand, some business individual owners who rely on the tourist trade for their income can be adversely affected by an lower number of tourists. For example, in recent years, the whole world face and suffer from pandemic and the influx of tourists is restricted. As a result, main part of companies face financial problems because of lack of money while the others are failed. In conclusion, tourism brings benefits to personal business owners by making up a large proportion of the national income of companies while it has some drawbacks such as being affected in a negative way from decreasing number of tourists.

Problems for Japan companies under CPTPP,"First, In CPTPP, Annex I and II, each CPTPP member state has some non-conforming measures that allow governments to maintain exceptions to the CPTPP services and investment chapters, transparently identifying measures, activities, or sectors where the chapters' obligations do not apply. As a result, you should pay close attention to the reservations mentioned. As an example: according to Annex II, Section 2 (Cross-Border Trade in Services and Investment), Singarpore reserves the right to maintain or adopt any measure affecting: “(a) the full or partial devolvement to the private sector of services provided in the exercise of governmental authority; (b) the divestment of its equity interests in, and/or the assets of, an enterprise that is wholly owned by the Singapore government; etc. ”
Second, lack of ISDS experience: Japanese companies are hesitant to use arbitration, whether commercial or investment-related. So far, only three publicly known investor-state arbitration cases have been initiated by Japanese investors. As of today, all of the proceedings are still pending.

Third, under pandemic, Australia, and Malaysia apply FDI restriction in some certain sectors but still 100% FDI friendly for manufacturing and most of the service industries. Especially, New Zealand government has introduced a temporary notification regime and announced that national interest test will temporarily apply to all foreign investments, regardless of dollar value, that result in more than a 25% ownership interest, or that increase an existing stake in a New Zealand asset to, or beyond, 50%, 75% or 100%.

Is social media presence necessary for small businesses to succeed?,"In this technological era, social media is used by many small businesses to increase their visibility. They upload all the information about the products or services on social media to let people know more about them. I think it is necessary for small businesses presence on social media, this is because it helps them to connect with their existing customers, increase their customer base, and help build brand awareness.

First and foremost, social media allows small businesses to stay in touch with their existing customers. They can get the latest feedback by messaging their existing customers on social media. This action helps them make adjustment to meet the needs of their customers. In short, small businesses can not only retain their existing customers, but also ensure that existing customers are not attracted to other competitors.

Secondly, social media helps to increase the customer base of small businesses. This is because social media has a search function, it enables customers to find the items or goods that they need. This may save time for both sellers and buyers as customers can quickly target and find the items they need to buy, while sellers can save time finding new customers. To sum up, social media not only helps small businesses discover new potential customers but also promotes their products to the public.

Thirdly, small businesses use social media to build awareness of their products. Since social media marketing is now a trend, they can advertise on social media to gain publicity. In addition, advertising on social media is cheap, which is very friendly to small businesses. In conclusion, social media allows small businesses to create awareness and increase their sales.

In conclusion, social media is a great platform for small businesses to expand their business by increasing the visibility of their products, thereby increasing sales. Social media is also a powerful channel for them to interact with their existing customers while creating new business opportunities. Therefore, small businesses should seize the opportunity of social media to achieve their business goals. ",No,Yes,6.5
"In any field like business, politics, education, and government, should those in power be required to step down after five years?","The are two kinds of people in this world: ones with power and the ones without it. Everyone tries to reach the pinnacle, but only a few succeed. Hence, it is easy for someone who just reached it to get used to the benefits associated with it, but this has to be reprimanded as suggested by the claim. Thus, I completely agree with the claim that in all the fields, the people in power should step down after five years of their tenure.

First and foremost, in my opinion, the claim is valid as it provides a stage for the young leaders to take the metaphorical ‘throne’. The youngsters are not only motivated but comply with the contemporary norms much better than their counterparts. While motivation is important, there is one which is far more important: novelty. The existing leaders are rigid and sticklers to the rules and the young are more inclined towards breaking the norms with their breakthrough ideas. They often seek for new ways of managing their businesses, which drives the innovation that is much needed.

Secondly, the new leaders, who might not be young, can also be productive. The routines of the existing leaders are broken, paving a path for a budding blossom of creativity and innovation, the two most important virtues of any field. While some might argue that rules and routines are made for a specific reason, we need to assess if the reasons are still applicable in the ever changing situations such as now.

Moreover, if the leaders are given free rein without any such constraints as their tenure, they develop characteristics that have negative impacts. For example, we can take the scenario of anarchy and dictatorship that arises with unlimited tenures. Also, in the current world, there can be other issues such as corruption that are reared by the leaders if they are not kept under the leash.

Finally, taking a one-sided stance is never fruitful - we must also consider the problems posed by changing the leaderships frequently. The new leaders, though with good intentions, might take wrong decisions due to their inexpertise. Additionally, the risks they take can prove counterproductive in very rare cases as stability is also crucial. Taking too much risk is not advantageous and it could even bring down the whole company.

In conclusion, for the reasons stated above, I believe that the claim is credible. As there are a few threats, it is with caution we need to follow this. In the myriad factors that affect the success of an organisation, the tenure is one, but not the only - experience and handling also matters as much. Therefore, ideally, there needs to be an equilibrium, but in",No,No,6

One problem faced by almost every large city is traffic congestion.What do you think the causes are?What solutions can you suggest?,"Traffic jam is indeed a major hurdle which a lot of cities currently are suffering from. This alarming trend poses many threats and must be addressed by several definite actions.

First and foremost, two primary causes lead to the overloading of the roads. The first reason is that majority of people prefer using their private cars rather than using public transport. The underlying reasons for this phenomenon are comfort and safety. Especially in the rush hours, the buses take more passengers than their actual capacity which of course can be inconvenient for people who have just left the work and are exhausted. Furthermore, an absence of the seatbelts in public vehicles worry many parents and therefore they opt to leave their children to school with in/ by their private cars which leads to traffic congestion in the school areas. The second reason is that the constructing construction of new buildings in the busiest streets both that increasing increases both the number of cars in the city centre and constraints the original capacity of the road by seizing its area.

However, measures should be taken by the government to alleviate the negative impacts of over-reliance on cars and creating new residential areas. Firstly, the government can confine its local budget to improving the public transport infrastructure by increasing the number of buses in the traffic and provide buses with more safe seats. These alterations will diminish the number of private cars on the roads and encourage parents to let their children use public transport. Secondly, the government can impose a higher rate of taxes on the construction companies which are willing to build houses in some particular areas of the city. ",No,Yes,6.5
There are too many cars are roads today.This situation leads to many problems are goverment and people should tackle this problem taking into consideration of public transport.,"The numbers of cars on our roads today increased considerably and at its turn it includes many other issues. People and authorities should be responsible for dealing with his problem with consideration of public transport. It can't denied that this is real issue and can bring some additional bad consequences if not solved. Such problems and its possible solutions will be described further in the essay.

The first problem that needs to be solved in the pollution of urban areas. A huge number of cars emit an anormous amount of poisonous gasses as carbon dioxide which may result in poor health condition of the inhabitants. In order to solve this issue goverment should raise the taxes on fuel and this consequently reduces the number of cars on the roada and individuals should be willing to use environmentally friendly means of transport.

Another negative effect of too many cars in the cities is traffic congestion which brings a lot of delays or road rage which definitely affects the social life. The main solution of this situation is definitely improvement of the public transport services by the side of the officials which leads to the frequent usage of them. Furthermore, commuters must try to be more loyal towards the utilization of buses and trains. The final point to consider in the road safety which might be poorly managed due to a big number of vehicles. If this is not tackled the results may be fatal and disastrous for the site of humanity higher fines and strict road control should be established by the authorities and drivers must act responsible when driving in order to improve this situation.

It can be concluded that solution of extreme number of cars is vital as it results in other sub-problems. The officials should be fight against it with strict legislation and better public transport while the citizen must reduce the car usage",No,No,6.5
"In order to solve traffic and environmental issue; Some cities have vehicle-free days when cars are banned from the city, and the only vehicles permitted are public transport. To what extent do you agree or disagree that the benefits of this outweigh the disadvantages?","The influx of cars in the major cities is the number one contributing factors of pollution around the world. Some metropolitan areas encourage commuters to utilize public transportation and restricting car owners to enter the town. In my opinion, I agree that the benefits of having private cars on the road on certain days will have a positive impact on the surroundings.

To begin with, the government should build an effective transport system where people can use like trains and buses. for example, in London there are transport alternatives like past tubes and double buses in every corners of major shopping areas. In addition, there are timetables that the people could expect when is the train or bus coming in as well as the tickets can be used for both public transports. In this way people may feel comfortable and would have an easy life when going to the city.

Furthermore, fare ticket is another way to persuade people to use public transport. For instance, pensioners and students should be given discount ticket and some people should be given some vouchers to lower their payment for the travel ticket. In this way, people can motivate themselves not to use their own cars because they have the cheapest option to travel.

In conclusion, although the prohibition of car owners coming to the largest city in particular days is one way to tackle the environmental the authorities should look into other alternative ways to convince people to use the public transport network. ",No,Yes,6.5
Both government investment in public transport systems and reductions in public transport ticket prices will help to reduce transport pollution greatly. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"Reducing the amount of money spent on public transport system as well as lowering the rates of tickets of the public transport will largely assist in decreasing the transport pollution. I strongly disagree with the statement. Eliminating a basic need such as travelling will not necessarily decrease the pollution burden.

Firstly, poor people who rely on government transport will be greatly affected. lowering the investment on transports will result in less maintenance of the vehicle and reduction in their numbers. As a result common people who use these mode of transport to travel to their job will find it very difficult. An alternative method, for example investing correctly on vehicles which is ecofriendly will help in reducing pollution formed from vehicles rather than decreasing the investments on public vehicles.

Second common problem will be unemployment. Eliminating funds on transports and minimizing the ticket fare may indirectly decrease the wages of workers who works in transport sector. For instance driver of the bus, whose only source of income is by driving will have a strong negative impact. This will affect their quality of life in many ways.

To conclude, though reducing pollution by minimizing the investment on travelling vehicles seems a great idea consequences following the implementation of such acts must be analyzed first. ",No,Yes,6.5
Some believe that traffic problems can be solved by only allowing public transport in cities.other believe that there are better ways to solve traffic problems,"Traffic problems are increasing day by day with increasing population. it is believed by many people that allowing public transportation is the only way to overcome traffic problems while some individuals say there are many better solutions. both point of views will be discussed in further essay. There is no dought that allowing public transportation will reduce problems related to traffic but huge amount of money are required to develop new public transportation facilities. for an example, government spends million ruppes to start metros in big cities. this service is only use by few commuters who want save money. or who do not have hectic schedule.

Moreover, there are more beneficial ways to control traffic than allowing public transportation. bad infrastructure is one of the most reason for traffic problems. Infrastructure like road should be built wisely. Taking canada as an example, almost every city in canada have bicycle lanes, due to this drivers do not have to slow down their cars because slow speed of cyclists. Second reasons for traffic problems is some individuals who do not obey traffic rules. Such kind of people must be finned. In European countries, almost all citizens follow traffic rules due to high amount of fine.

In conclusion, i would say that allowing public transportation is a way to control traffic problems but there are many better ways should be implemented. ",No,Yes,6.5
One problem faced by almost every large city is traffic congestion. What do you think the causes are? What solutions can you suggest?,"Often people in bigger cities complain about traffic jams on the roads. There are many variables leading to this problem, and comfort and centralized cities tend to be a few of those many problems. Although there are many solutions, this essay will emphasize on increasing taxation and updating urban areas so that cities stop getting overcrowded. This essay will discuss the problems and solutions to traffic jams.

People are reluctant to travel in public busses and trains because it is more comfortable to travel in one's private car. Public transportations are mostly unmaintained and congested with excess people than it is supposed to contain, therefore, people are keen towards driving their own car, thus leading to more cars on the roads. For example, the majority of middle-class people nowadays own at least one car so they see it fit to drive it instead of being uncomfortable in a public coach. Furthermore, the cities are too centralized therefore easily overcrowded. More cars traveling towards cities from urban areas can lead to traffic jams; because those areas are not updated enough and do not provide most of the facilities. If the government does not focus is on updating urban areas, in the near future the cities will get more crowded.

On the other hand, many solutions ought to be there, but the most effective one would be to decrease the number of private vehicles on the roads. Whereas, it might only be possible to do that by imposing extra taxes on the purchase of private cars; if the rate of taxes increases then purchases of individually owned cars may decrease. For example, it was observed in a survey in Bangladesh, that the purchase of private cars decreased by 30% after the government imposed 400% taxes upon private cars. Meanwhile, the government should focus on making developments to urban areas; plan to make sky trains and add other types of facilities that are available in larger cities, so that people visit the town less frequently.

In conclusion, this essay discussed the problems that lead to traffic jams and also the solutions that the government should take into consideration. It is for the government bodies to make sure that the public transports are well maintained and to make development to urban areas so that the traffic may be well controlled. ",No,No,6.5
What are the pros and the cons of using public transport,"Public transport are more and more used by the majority of the people. thus, they are shipe and also help to decrease the c02 in the air, since many cars holder leave their cars parked to use them. That said, the delay at times of arrival and departure are the general reason why many people avoid to use public transport. i will discuss in the essay, the advantages and the disadvantages of the way of transport and try to draw some conclusions.

Let's start by looking at the positives of the public transport. The main benefits is, it is a way to preserve the environment. By using the public transport, people left their cars parked at home, so less cars are generating co2. which means public tranport is a reason to decrease the pollution speacially in the big cities. Another significant aspect of taking public transport, is to cut of depenses, since it is shipe comparing to the cost of aful and generally it s a good way to socialize and makes new relation.

on the other side of the argument, the major disadvantage this way of transport is the delay. rarelly, the times of departures and arrivals are respected for a reason or another, and since the users are limited by the time, like worjers who usualy start works at 8 pm can not allow being late for their work. Furthermore, some kind of transport, lack hygien at the point they are known by being derty all the time. The New york metero is a real exemple of this situation. the bad smells is the indicator that yoiu are already under the ground.

All things considered, public transport can be a great way to make the life easier by offering a better services to the customers. personaly, i beleive that is essental. That said, goverment should inverst more in this sector to attract more customers. ",No,Yes,6.5
Some people think it is more important to spend money on roads and motorways than on public transport systems. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays, fifty percent of people believe that government should investing in tracks, bridges, highways instead of expanding public transportation. From my point of view, public transportation is intrinsic part of each cities. So, every cities governments have to focus on their public transportation.

There are several reasons why I would argue against spending money on roads and motorways than on public transport systems. Firstly, scientists predict that cities population would increase in next 50 years. So just public transportation could survive cities from heavy traffic and clogging the streets. On the other words, governments should devise new ideas to expand a public transportation ad a solution to face population growth. Secondly, people tend to use their own cars as a result of concentrating on roads and tracks leads that leads to air pollution as a massive problem. Finally, gas consuming will increase as a result of utilize personal cars.

On the other hand, if government focus on track and public transportation simultaneously, so it would be appropriate for civilian. They can use their personal cars in emergency cases. Also they can use public transportation to save their expenses. Furthermore, expanding the roads prevent a disruptive and heavy traffic in cities. So satisfaction of civilian is increased as a result of this. ",No,No,6
More and more city workers are deciding to live in the country and travel into work every day. The result is increased traffic congestion and damage to the environment. What measures do you think could be taken to encourage people not to travel such long distances into work?,"There are greater and greater humans moving out from huge cities to suburban areas to live. This is causing might also issues from traffic to environment due to the fact most of the jobs now are reachable in the large cities, so humans have to travel returned into the cities every day to work. To handle this problem, there are some remedies.

To commence with, the government should minimize the gap between the geographical region and the metropolis with the aid of setting up and relocating factories and administration offices to the rural areas to create jobs for people. They will still live in suburban areas with their suitable jobs and solely have to journey quick distances to work. Besides, technologically speaking, thanks to the improvement of technology, there are extra possibilities for people to work on line at home. So, there are no motives why organizations should no longer let their people work at home, possibly two days per week and then go into work in the rest of the week.

A very distinct way to deal with the hassle is encouraging people to remain in cities with the aid of improving the exceptional of life there. For example, the government should spend extra money to limit crime and society evils as those are the principal motives why people do now not favor to stay in the cities. Furthermore, as nicely as the surroundings can be made cleaner and agreeable to stay with extra green trees and fewer skyscrapers. In these ways, human beings might be encouraged to remain as a substitute than transferring out.

In conclusion, there are many approaches to overcome the state of affairs in each the geographical region and city factors of view. The government, as well as all of society’s components, need to be a part of fingers to find the high-quality solution for these issues. ",No,Yes,6.5

What solutions can you suggest?,"It is widely known that virtually any mega polis in the world suffers from congestions and the population has to spend considerable amount of time a roads. This essay will discuss that it results mainly from excess private transport usage and poor infrastructure and put forward a number of solutions to address the issue.

It is true to say that the cause for roads congestions are mostly commuting via private auto and it emerges big traffic jams in rush hours, when all residents must go to work/school or the opposite should go back home. Therefore, one of the multiple solution is that people should to encourage to use public transport or do a purchase to have an own bicycle to ride; it is cheap, healthy and convenient. In addition, it is also on trend to share with cars.

Moreover, it is clear and should be highlighted that many countries have poor infrastructure, so that is why cars literally cannot move rightly. Also, narrow ways that are cause for many car accidents should be wider and even have an extra space for cyclists, to reduce the case of accidences. Hence, to tackle these problems the government should to put afford to change the situation. For example, they can build highways to wider the number of constructed roads, expanding roads. Then, maybe traffic issues will be mitigated.

However, in this essay I will discuss various approaches about it.

First and foremost, in this modern world mobile phones have become a vital part in our life but some it may create various problems for humans for instance, the libraries such places where people go for reading something so that they can read peacefully environment but if someone use mobile then then obviously people get irritates as a result it really essential that mobiles should be banned in libraries. Secondly, shops are such places where people like to do shopping comfortably therefore, during shopping if someone talking loudly there then no doubt people will get disturb they can't enjoy their shopping. The last but not least, mostly people use mobile phones frequently during travelling without consider bad consequences for example, every day huge number of people get victim of road accidents due to mobile because they use phones and their distract.

From my perspective, I am totally agree with this statement. Phones have lots benefits but as well as it has some problems therefore, people can use mobiles but they should be considered places that where they are.

"In order to solve traffic problems, government should tax private car owners heavily and use the money to improve public transportation. What are the advantages and disadvantages of sucb a solution? Give reasons foe your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Traffic congestion is a long and unresolve phenomenon that different countries are experiencing with. Some say, private car owners should be tax heavily by the government and use the money to improve public transportation. With this, positive and adverse side arises and we will tackle them as we go along with this essay.

To begin with, one of the positive side of this agenda is that less people will sought to buy private cars. They will just commute with public transportations like trains and buses thus, reducing traffic problems. Furthermore, improvement of public transportation will happen; additional buses and trains will occur and numerous people will be catered well.

On the other hand, if this will be legalize, private car owners will object; thus followed by chaos within people and government. In addition, overcrowding will occur if large quantity of people will use the public transportation. Car companies will have a low sales of their cars, somehow affecting the economy of the country.

"On vehicle-free day, private cars, trucks and motorcycles are banned in the city centre while the public transport is permitted such as bicycle, buses and taxis. Do the benefits of vehicle- day outweigh the disadvantages?","Undoubtedly, we all are dwelling into modern report, which has a list of great changes in majority of field, specially in vehicles. Owing to this fact, on the vehicle free day, the public transport is permitted by the government and in the city centre the private transports are banned. Although, there are some pros of it, cons cannot be neglected.

On the other hand, there are some benefits of it, first and foremost, alleviate the traffic jams and pollution. In simple words, if the government should do not allowed the private vehicles and permit only public vehicles, then the chances of traffic jams and air-pollution accompanying solution will reduce. For instance, if a person using his private car or motorcycle to commute. Later on, when he enters the city centre there will be more vehicles before him. After that, he will blow horn which creates noise pollution and the smoke which releases from those vehicles will mix in air and when a person inhale an oxygen then that harmful smoke enters in his body and heart and his body from inside and traffic jams will be there.

On the other hand, there are also some drawbacks, people face obstacles in their daily routine. To be justified, Everyone has their own vehicles and they have to go to for a work as they are busy in their hectic schedule and they have to go to for a work to eke out bread and butter for themselves and for their family as well. Apart from it, there is a particular time of public vehicles and we have to reach at a time at the bus stop to get a bus. If an individual got late for his work, he can lost his job and then he face a plethora of hinders while searching for a job. As we know, it is not an easy to survive in this high-tech era.

In conclusion, as per my above discussion, there are several advantages and disadvantages. However, I personally believe that, over take its cons, as there are more merits of it than demerits. ",No,No,5.5
Transportation: advantages and disadvantages of public transportation.,"In present scenario, public transportation has become important factor to people. Using public transportation reduces the number of vehicles and slow down of climate crisis. But there are some problems while taking mass transits. The essay will examine the positives and negatives of public transportation.

The two main merits of mass transportation are possibility to avoid traffic jams and reduces less smog. Firstly, using public transits can reduces the traffic congestion especially in the cities. For example, instead of using private own car, people should used various aspects of commuting such like bus line, light rail and subways. Therefore, it decrease the traffic blockage in the town. Secondly, number of smog produces by the several transports. Reducing the private vehicles can decline in producing of smog. It will slow down of greenhouse gas emissions. For instance, electric train is the best public transportation for the people. Henceforth, it is eco-friendly technology.

However, mass transits also has some major demerits like taking long hours and less comfortable. Here, public transports are moved accordingly to the time set by the government. Public transportation like buses and light trains have to wait in every station which makes longer time to reach the destination. Addition to that, most people preferred bus or train which creates less convenient compared to cars. Furthermore, there are limited seat in the bus or train where people don’t get a enough seat and stand for longer hours until reaching the individual destination.

To conclude, although public transportation has certain cons like less comfortable and waiting longer duration, it has an extremely pros impacts on environmental-nature and free movement of vehicles in the cities. ",No,Yes,6.5
some people think funds must be used to develop rail tracks others think it is good to develop existing public transport. Discuss both views and give your opinion,"National expenditure for transportation is always an area of heavy debate. Few people think that funds should be channeled for developing the rail tracks, which benefits the connectivity with big cities, however, others believe that it must be used for strengthening the old system. In my opinion, it is more vital to renovate the existing transport.

Firstly, super fast trains ease the travel load among the cities and is beneficial in connecting with other nations. Long journeys tend to be experienced at our comfort. In addition, they are cheaper, safer and causes less pollution which is an added advantage. The journey time can be cut down when compared with other modes. The quality of infrastructure for swift electric trains reduces the dependency on other modes. For instance, Japan introduced the electric trains in their country which are consistently cutting down the burden on different means of transport.

On the other hand, public services cater diverse section of the society. The local transmission for the people both in rural and urban are the buses and roads which render them with easiest and flexible timings, where rail ways cannot reach. For example, India has three-quarter of majority in the rural areas increasing the dependency on less sophisticated modalities of transport. Moreover, buses travel to remote areas where it is difficult to access any means at any cost. Therefore, it is vital to devote funds for local transport.

In conclusion, though people opinion vary for National transport expenditure, it is extremely crucial to use it to improve the public transport before, drawing the attention towards building better tracks to suit for super fast trains. The plans for express trains can be reserved for the future. ",No,Yes,6.5

When I went out, I happened to meet someone traveling to Da Nang who was looking for a way to travel easily. I advised her on the types of public transportation that Da Nang is developing, such as tech Grab, taxis, buses, bicycles. Now all kinds of transportation are very convenient, and the service is also very good. These types of vehicles Grap is the type of vehicle that many people choose the most, because this type of vehicle is cheap, available everywhere, and low in cost. But it is also a means of transportation used by many people, but the cost is a bit high, the traffic is also complicated, traffic jams, and it is convenient in rainy days, and people use a lot. In all the above methods, you should choose the type of technology that uses Grap. In short, public transportation is very popular and it is very convenient for people to go anywhere.

"Some people say that the best way to reduce traffic congestion is to provide free bus service 24 hours per day, 7 days a week. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays, traffic jam has become a major problem of living in urban areas. There is a school of thought that providing free services of public transportation like bus is the most effective solution to this particular drawback. While I agree that it can be a great way to reduce the number of peak hours, improving transport facilities is a far superior option.

To begin with, it must be acknowledged that making bus service completely free of charge can be beneficial for several reasons. Firstly, people would undoubtly find bus to be more viable mean of travelling should this policy be enforced. This will undoubtedly reduce the number of private vehicles, which are the key factors of traffic congestion. Secondly, a full-time bus system means that individuals can be more flexible with their schedule. As a matter of fact, the main reason why people still prefer cars despite the cost is because they can travel without worrying about the time of departure.

However, I would argue that making improvement in transport facilities is much more effective than the aforemention method. To begin with, the deteriorating roads are actually the causes of numerous accidents, which not only cause detrimental impacts on human lives but also prevent the flow of traffic. Therefore, governments are recommended to spend expenditure on modifying highways and road signs to minimize the frequency of accident. Moreover, subway or bus systems are in dial need of transformation, since they are reknowned for being slow and full of little inconvenience. Indeed, experts claims that people would be willing to pay more for a well-monitored, modern public means of transport.

In conclusion, while the benefits of free bus service cannot be denied, I believe that making the necessary adjustments to the current travelling system would be better in the long term. ",No,Yes,6.5
private vehicles are increasing but on the other hand use of public transport is best source as far as transportation is concerned. Governments should spend more money on railways and comparatively low on roads. This essay will argue that why I totally agree with the statement.,"Nowadays private vehicles are increasing but on the other hand use of public transport is best source as far as transportation is concerned. Governments should spend more money on railways and comparatively low on roads. This essay will argue that why I totally agree with the statement.

To commence with, pollution is one of the major issue caused by private vehicles which are roadways such as bikes and cars whereas trains or railways being public vehicle can carry hundreds of people and as compare to roadways there will be less population. For instance, in Delhi there was a report that 86% of pollution is due to roadways. So alternative method is that government should expend more money make expand railway system in every city.

Furthermore, railways will have more advantages than roadways. Also, metropolitan cities would have limited traffic and it would be because there will be less roadways. To think about future, if these railways are spent more amount of money they will be automated and will have less chances of accidents as root cause of accidents is due to human error. For example, metro trains are more relaxing, convenient, cheap and safe for a traveler. Overall, people would be benefited more if railway systems are expanded.

In conclusion, as government thinks about pros and cons of a particular thing and then it takes an action therefore in this case their is inclination towards railways. As it provides safety and there is no harm to air quality so it should be given priority. ",No,Yes,6.5
"Some people think that more money should be spend to permote the use of bicycle in city, other howover believe that cities should forcus on investing in public transport system dicuss both view and give your opinion.","According to some individuals, government should spend the more money encouraging bicycle in the cities, while other people believe that, public transport should their main aim of the funding. In my opinion both are equally

sufficient.

Serveral residents have two main reason, to investing the money on the cycle. first reason is that help to minimize the pollution in urban area. for instance human deal with traffic jam that is caused of toxic air like carban monoxide. Other than, the citizens want to go one place to another place by bicycle. as to live fit and healthy. for example. better environment provide to live in healthy environment and freshness which are good health.

On the other hand, income support to people is main benefit of promote the transport services. Such as, if government give the more fincial support to the another transportation like bus, train and so on, that services will provide the more job opportunities for citizens. Moreover, the second reason is changing seasons environment yearly. For instance, bicycle is not suitable for gole Ager and unfit person. Those people can not travel by bicycle in the long distance and rainy months so that will travell by the public services, it is quite safe for them.

Finally, as for as i am concerned, government give funds to both services, as they are necessary for all citizens. follow a example l, if government invest the money on bicycle and transport, these are the benifits to all ages of people and decrease the polluted gass.

To sum up, goverment provide funding to the both services because these are equally important for physical and mental health. ",No,No,6.5
owning a car/ pubLic transport,"On the one hand, there are a couple of advantages to owning a car. First, in life, people move from one place to another place a lot. For example, people who own a car can have freedom and comfort while moving, especially when traveling people don’t be late or limited on travel. In addition, personal car give comfort and safety while traveling in contrast to public transport. For example, drivers can listen to music or talk with family and friends everytime in the car.

On the other hand, it is important to point out the benefits of public transport. First, public transport is environmentally-friendly. For example, in the big city, the pollutant release by car is large, so the public transport system reduces pollutants and deals with traffic jams. Furthermore, using public transport save money for commuters. For example, owning a car is very expensive, the owner must pay for insurance and petrol. ",No,Yes,6
It has been argued that making the gas price increase is the optimal method to tackle traffic congestion and pollution problems,"It has been argued that making the gas price increase is the optimal method to tackle traffic congestion and pollution problems. While it would be seen some positive effects to a few aspects when following this way, but I disagree with this point of view and believe that there are other effective remedies to solve the problems above.

On the one hand, with the rising cost of petrol, people would prefer to limit their vehicle’s usage in the beginning, then tend to find and change into alternative energies which are economical, renewable, and friendly with the environment. In this case, the environmental issue might be slightly decreased; on the contrary, the congestion would not be solved. Another drawback from the growth of the oil price might be increasing the fee of large transport means such as bus, coach, and train which are expected to restrict the number of private vehicles circulating on the road. Therefore, increasing the gas cost would not be the best answer for the two questions of traffic and pollution.

On the other hand, luckily there are several effective remedies to deal with these dilemmas. In my opinion, investing to find environmentally friendly energies such as solar power could be the ticket. They are essential due to the fact of resource exhaustion recently and could decrease bad impacts on the air pollution from using petrol. The second method is that the government should encourage citizens to use public transportations more frequently and limit personal vehicles by several practical actions. For example, if people can travel by bus at no charge, I believe that the number of those taking the bus will increase significantly. In addition, putting heavy taxes on personal vehicles such as motorbikes and cars might be a consideration.

In conclusion, increasing the price of petrol is not the best way to resolve the growing traffic congestion and pollution. Thus, an effective way to control the aforementioned issues would be to use other renewable sources of energy and simulate travel by public means of transport which can significantly bring down traffic and pollution problems.

many people think that the government should spend more money on providing faster and cheaper means of public transportation.some others think that there are other important factors to take into consideration like (petrolcost and environment) Discuss both views and give your opinion,"Government plays a vitel role to the development of society. In this reagrd, some people believe administration should implement more fund only on public transportation. Whereas, others opine this, on their view there are more other issues to be considerd like, fuel price and environmental issues. However, this essay analyse both statement's deeply by including appropriate examples. On the one hand, the former group argued that the government should raise fund to develop the public transportation. In this regard, people stop using privet vehicle, if there is a comfortable journey and a low ticket fare. Futhoremore, money should sped by providing on public vehicle's by fixing fully air-conditioned and run on electric and a good service. Moreover, amount of public vehicle's should increase. On top of that, these factors will oy happen when there a inuff financial support from the side of government as like the first group mentioned. The latter group, on the other hand, deem that, not only fund needed from government to improve transportation facilities, but also there are more other important factors to consider by authorities, such as in the field of petroleum and environment. to be precise, pollution is the major cause that the people face to date, on this regard, if government promot sufficient money to control pollution by launching more recycling units as well as priventing the use of plastics by fixing appropriate trash box in each places. in addition to this, substance's that are harm to nature should be erased. Moreover fossil fuel price is the another drawback that each individual face, so, if government take in charge of this privet fuel pumbs and control the rate which everyone can afford. to cite an example, In Arab nation the fuel price is very low because allthe pumps are in under the higher authorities control. In my opinion, government should implement more fund to protect nature and control the fuel price to help. constructing untis to recycle the materials. Hence, by providing these features it not only help human but also it help the species too to live.

"Some people think more money should be paid on railway construction while others argue, and say this money only should be spent to public transport. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","The importance of transportation is inevitable. However, Some people claim that more money should be spent on the construction of railways between the correlation of cities while others believe not and they reckon the priority has to be bestowed upon public transport. Opinion of mine will be given After discussing both views.

On the one hand, the railway system has altered our journey immensely. To add to it, the railway helps us enormously in order to pass long distances within a short time. For example, cities like Beijing and Wuhan need only 3 hours to reach each place from one another. If we invest more money only for making the railway fast, then the ratio of time spent will be declined readily so that we would be able to suffice to any city by few hours. Eventually, it is apparent that the fastest railway system we have, the easier travel privileges there will be.

On the other hand, allocating large sums of money to public transport could be worthwhile. Noticeably, traffic congestion is a concerning affair nowadays and unless the government outlay money for this sector how this issue will be reduced? Improving the availability of public transportation can diminish the traffic problem and this effort will decline the enthusiasm of using private vehicles on the road. Moreover, once people start using public conveyance than personal vehicles, traffic jams will get decreased and people also will be able to travel anywhere at a low cost as well.

To sum up, although each argument has its significance to travel, I would choose both opinions as these are not only beneficial for correlation among cities but also to resolve the issue within the city.

There is no future for public transport,"People are increasingly using their cars regularly, and some are divided between many forms of transport. Nonetheless, I believe that alternative means of transport will continue to exist in the future. The statement written above is entirely false and that is why I would like to provide a logical explanation.

To begin with, cars, without a doubt, provide unrivalled freedom and convenience. Even late at night, when the public transport system is, anybody is free to go wherever they want. Furthermore, they are not required to follow a strict train or bus schedule, which might be troublesome while travelling to work or an appointment.

On the other hand, not only would owning a car be costly since everyone has to pay for maintenance and repairs but it would also require the renewal of the driver's license every few years. In contrast, local citizens who do not own a car will be relieved of the burden of paying such fees. As a result, they may save more money and spend it on other items they would like to.

When it comes to environmental issues, the consequences of pollution on the ecosystem should not be overlooked. Pollution from cars has been shown to be harmful to our environment, and if we do not regulate pollution, the existing situation will worsen. Therefore, many people should make the most use of trains or buses instead.

To sum up, although cars generate a significant portion of our life, other means of transport such as trains, buses, and taxis also play a significant role. I am confident that both kinds of public systems will continue to be developed in the future. ",No,Yes,6.5
Solution to encourage people use public transport,"To begin with, people should raise public awareness or attitude towards public transport by holding workshops. Moreover, public transport companies can invite celebrities to use so they can spread the word to the public easily. Likewise, these companies also should decrease public transportation fares and upgrade the quality infrastructure. Because people tend to use something cheap but still clean or polite. Thus, they can attract customers' attention, if they apply both solutions. On the other hand, the government has to raise taxes on private vehicles. For example, if a car is taxed within the family's budget, they will continue to buy it. Therefore, the government needs to impose a very high tax. ",No,No,6
‘ Unsurprisingly Copenhagen came out on top in the latest report on cycling usage . Cycling is a way of life in the Danish capital and most residents (62%) prefer to commute by bike rather than car. That’s because it boasts a great network of cycle paths and bridges that make it safe and speedy for cyclists to zip through the city. ( Source : The Lonely Planet 2018 ) Should governments spend more money on cycle paths as a way of reducing traffic congestion ? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience .,"I highly disagree with the notion of the stem that building dedicated cycle paths will reduce traffic congestion. There are millions of cars running over the roads every other day and they are helping tens of millions of people reach their destination without facing any hurdles. However, very often we see that cars are not able to go forward because of some obstacles on the roads and this causes discomfort to the passengers and passerbys. Now, there are several reasons behind traffic jams. One of them is damaged roads. When a road is damaged, the cars cannot move smoothly over it hence, they have to slow down and traffic congestion happens. Therefore, the government could spend money on making the roads better and wider. Moreover, impatience and lack of skill among drivers is also a factor in a traffic jam. The inadept drivers often break the traffic rules and this disrupts the way cars move on the road. Hence, the administration shouldn't provide a driving license to people who are bad at driving and should punish those who don't follow the traffic rules and regulations.

On the other hand, establishing cycle paths to reduce traffic congestion may seem impressive on paper but, has certain flaws. First of all, cycles are open vehicles so, they might be fun riding on a clear day. However, it is impossible to ride a bicycle under the scorching heat of the sun or when it is raining cats and dogs. So, essentially, building cycle paths aren't a great way to reduce traffic jam. As we won't be able to ride them throughout the 12 months of the year. I live in a busy city and every day I used to get late for college as the number of cars in my city is high and the roads are way too much narrow. Thankfully, our city's mayor realized this issue and renovated all the major routes. Accordingly, traffic jams in our city decreased significantly. To summarize, building cycle routes are not the ideal way to reduce traffic jams as there are better methods than that. ",No,No,6.5
sing public transport has become familiar to everyone in Vietnam. Millions of people today are travelling by lots of kinds of public transport. Some people think that using public transport brings a lot of advantages to the society in general and to themselves in particular; others argue that they have to face disadvantages when using public transport.,"In recent years, public transport has become a broad issue to the general public. Some people think that there are benefits from it, while others hold the view that there are disadvantages with it. In this essay, I will discuss why public transport is so popular and some negatives of using it.

There are some main benefits of using public transport. Firstly, it reduces air pollution. When more and more people use public transport, there will be fewer private cars on the road. This helps reduce air pollution and thus improve air quality. For example, According to a study, the rate of air pollution from motorcycles is increasing, so it is necessary to reduce the number of vehicles away from traffic. Another advantage is that people can be more productive while taking public transportation. When you are driving, you have to focus on the road ahead of you. But if you take public transportation, you can finish an assignment, read a book or let your mind wander.

However, there are some disadvantages to public transport. Firstly, taking public transport creates an uncomfortable feeling for passengers during rush hour. For instance, in Ho Chi Minh City, traffic jams often occur during rush hour, which makes bus passengers especially the elderly and children feel headaches and nausea. Secondly, Currently, some public transports are broken down, which can cause unsafety for passengers.

In conclusion, public transport is a good way to get around, especially in cities where its frequency and reliability are quite good. However, taking a bus or train during rush hours is uncomfortable. ",No,Yes,6.5

Most people consider that it is convenient and fast(rapid), besides, choosing to take the public transportation has a great number of advantages. I completely agree that we should take the public transportation instead of taking private vehicles.

In terms of positive aspect, it enables to reduce pollution and protect our environment. Furthermore, when taking the public transportation, all individuals could save much money. Most importantly, people can not only avoid traffic jam in the rush hour, but also arrive destination more quickly than others who drive cars.

It is obvious that taking public transportation is more convenient than driving cars. Owing to attract more commuters, government launch many different tickets to promote public transportation. Some companies also focus on traveling to catch people’s eyes, for example, there are lots of rails with beautiful scenery which attract people to visit or travel. When we take the public transportation, we can relax and enjoy yourself.

All in all, as far as I concerned, public transportation is better than private vehicles. People don’t need to take much time to avoid traffic jam, and waste time finding parking lot. Therefore, we have chance to decrease the pollution, also help us save money and time. ",No,Yes,6
"Although public transportation may be economical, it takes a great deal longer to arrive at your destination. To what extent do you agree?","In today’s world air pollution is a very big and terrible problems for all people because we are losing our vital component of life – oxygen. One of the most reason for this are private auto. That is why using public transportation is one of beneficial way to prevent air pollution. However, I am convinced that public transportation has some disadvantages such as spending a lot of time in order to reach our destination. 73

The first main problem is that travelling by bus takes a lot of time because a driver should go through all stations so as to pick up passengers. Every time when driver stops to pick up a person, it takes a few seconds, but overall, it may become several minutes. Additionally, it is not only about wasting time, but also about being problems for other drivers.

The second reason is the punctuality of buses and train that is frequently unreliable. Each person at least one time faced with the situation when they have to waiting for their bus or train, even though it should be here at that time. Because of this problem, the buses or trains become more crowded than it is supposed to be.

In conclusion, it is a widely held view that public transportation has very positive impact on road and air condition, but there are big disadvantages. It is my person conviction that trains and busses take more out time than private cars. Because of these inconvenience factor, many people do not want to commute with bus or train. ",No,No,6.5
Should public transportation be free for city residents?,"Firstly, making public transport free, the Government would be encouraging people to use public transport instead of driving to and from work. This would reduce the number of cars on the road. Global warming is a serious issue and if public transport was free, more people would use it, taking cars off the road. For example, one train could take 2000 cars off the road. A public transport system with 20 trains could take 40, 000 cars off the road.

Secondly, countless people of a country will get benefited from this and they can travel freely and use their earning to fulfil other basic needs. It helps people to get out of poverty. For instance, a bus ticket in uk is about £2, if a person takes the bus twice a day it means that the person would louse £1. 460 a year just on transportation. This money could be used to buy clothes, food or something that is really necessary.

However, public transportation services would be a monetary burden for the government. It would be difficult for the government to sustain it. This, in turn, would affect the quality and reliability of provided services. Additionally, in order to subsidise services, the government would have to use public money. This would be done at the expense of other sectors. Take, for example, education and healthcare. In order to make public transport free, authorities have to spend less on services like education and healthcare.

In conclusion, free public transportation would accelerate clean air and less traffic congestion in metropolitans. Nonetheless, the detrimental side-effects on the economy cannot be ignored. Therefore, I tend to believe that free-of-charge public transportation should be provided in most big cities. ",No,No,6.5
"In the wake of increasing levels of air pollution and decreasing quality of life, we should encourage people to use public transport like buses and trains rather than use their private vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In today’s world, transportation methods play pivotal role in our lives than ever before due to the growing number of population. The increasing necessity to the transportation contributes to the rising levels of air pollution and decrease in life quality. There is a great deal of debate concerning whether people ought to be made to utilize public transportation as the first option of going to somewhere. It is my firm belief that people should be stimulated to use public transportation for commuting.

First and foremost, from my point of view, the harm of the mounting levels of air pollution is much bigger than it is considered. That is to say, it causes a great number of disorders and deaths on people, and they do not even realize what is happening. In my opinion, having access to the integrated public transport system can help to reduce the need for personal vehicles and motivate people to use it. Moreover, people spend their hours in traffic jams and commuting, but these hours can be used to the best advantage of them by using public transit.

Secondly, I believe that upgrading and expanding public transportation provision can be profitable for the country. Due to over usage of private cars, the overloaded demand on fuel causes great troubles for countries, in terms of economics. If people were encouraged to avoid personal methods for traveling, it would be very beneficial for the finance of the country.

To sum up, due to damages of air pollution and economically incomes of public transportation, I am convinced that people should be motivated to utilize public transit as much as they can. ",No,Yes,6.5
the effects of traffic congestion,"With the increasingly number of vehicles, especially cars…, traffic congestion is one of the persistent problems in many major cities. In fact, it causes a lot of negative effects on people’s health and their personal life, as well as on the economic development and the environment of these areas.

The first serious disadvantage of usually suffering from congestion is that it harms for people’s health. First of all, it causes respiratory problems. During rush hour, road users can inhale dust or engine exhaust. Consequently, it increases the risk of developing diseases such as asthma, bronchitis or even lung cancer. Besides, being stuck in traffic makes people stressed, when they suffers from noise pollution made by car horn sound or moving under the bad weather in a long time. Finally, it also wastes much their energy because of the slow movement of vehicles.

The second disadvantage is that impacting badly on personal life of people. To begin with, it takes people much time commuting. They have to move their vehicle little by little, even stop completely at traffic hotpots. In addition, many statistics show that people tend to leave home earlier and return their home later in big cities. Moreover, it delays important works, for example picking up kids from school.

Another negative impact is that it contributes to cause the environmental destruction. In the first place, it makes the air quality become increasingly lower. Besides, it contributes to global warming due to a high mount of the emission of greenhouse gases, released directly into environment. Furthermore, those kind of gasses also damage to the ozone layer.

The final disadvantage is that it causes considerable damage to the national economic development. On the one hand, it has wasted the state budget. In fact, authorities spent thousands of billions of dong to find out a project that can ease traffic congestion or improve infrastructure. However, there has been no progress so far. On the other hand, it also reduces labor efficiency.

To sum up, traffic congestion is a head-aching issue that causes health damage, stagnant personal life, the environmental destruction and the economic damage. Therefore, authorities should take more timely measures to tackle it as sooner as better. Personally, if everyone’s awareness of participating in traffic is raised, the problem can be solved in the near future. ",No,Yes,6.5
"General idea We are all aware that since Covid-19 spreads out all over the world, many things have changed, especially the way we do business.","General idea

We are all aware that since Covid-19 spreads out all over the world, many things have changed, especially the way we do business. Where in past people prefer to conduct business in person as it ensure the delivery of our intentions, now we are no longer able to do so as freely as we used to live before. Because of this pandemic, many companies have to let their employees to start working from wherever they are, including from home.

Advantage Explanation + supporting ideas

The world we live today has evolved significantly, specifically in technological aspect. The computer, internet, and even smart phones are now more reliable than ever so that we can use it to communicate to each other as if they are really in front of us. In other words, it is not something impossible to be done.

This new protocol could be really beneficial for some workers who have to leave their family for long period of time, as now they can spend more time with their wife, children, and relatives. Besides that, working from home may also be great for your stress because you are working in your comfort zone.

Disadvantage Explanation + supporting ideas

However, some people may not be comfortable working from home as they might encounter so many potential distractions. Firstly, your discipline tends to be affected since when you are home, you do not bother to act professionally because your supervisors are not watching you all the time.

Secondly, your family members could also think that you can be somehow available to talk to all the time, which caused you to loosing your focus while working.

Conclusion

However, definitely, not all kind of works could be done remotely from home. Even if it possible, not only positive aspect will you get, but also the negative one. ",No,Yes,6.5
"Most Students believe that Online studies during covid 19 are helpful, to what extent do you agree?","Where Pandemic has changed so much in us, studies are also adversely effected. Just to cope with the loss of studies, virtual classrooms during pandemic are the most effective way to study, I agree to this argument because one can never put life in danger and this extensive loss of studies is unbearable.

Supporting the statement, the covid-19 has taken so much from us, our children and students are the future of tomorrow, no nation would ever think to loose them. School and universities were closed in the spur of moment when covid-19 was born, even me as a student was fearful to go out for my class. For instance, my exams were delayed, when cases were increasing to the peak.

With covid-19 in the air, the loss of studies is the most itching part, virtual classes were the great cover, students were sticking back to their routine of studying daily. From primary to higher level, students were shifted towards the digital classes, exams were conducted online to make the things floating with the stances going on. New ways to study were discovered, like my practicals were conducted online using digital simulations.

I conclude to that, to cope with this situation, studies should be conducted online so that we can save us and others most importantly and the unbearable loss of time and studies can be saved. It should be understood that we must learn to live with pandemic and try our best to bring things back to the route and the only most effective way to do that is through these virtual rooms.

Saving from being drown: Surviving the financial and life crisis in Covid age,"The tragedies that happened last year created so many worries in my life, such as money security, source of income, and a decent dwelling. These are the predicaments that I encountered I must act on to ease my problems and every day is another chance to find a solution, even though it is difficult but it is something that must be done.

From the feeling of drowning from the difficulties in my life now slowly, I am getting back on track by having a freelance job at an Australian company named “Home by belle” as a draftsperson. It is a breath of fresh air I am now employed. In this way, I am paying back the money that I lost. However, since job security is not a guarantee coming from everyone’s experiencing this pandemic. It was a lesson that I must save money for the rainy days, as I always have. Unfortunately, from being scammed. I must regain all this money and start from scratch.

Having a decent dwelling is a basic need of every human under circumstances we are not. There are a lot of things that I must do to achieve either migrating to another country or transferring to another apartment. Moving to another apartment during the pandemic is not ideal due to the fact that we do not have money to down for another house. I need to stay in this house due to internet connections, etc. I need more than a year to regain my money unless I got another part-time job to hasten it a little. For my migration requirements, I just need to pass my IELETS by May and I must work hard to study in order for us to move to greener Pasteur in another country.

On the other hand, someone from my former colleague asked me to get together. I was shocked because I thought no one would ask me out of the blue. I dislike the guy, an acquittance is alright for me, but I do not see him more than that. I do not know if I want to date anyone right now. My target for this year is to regain my lost money and nothing more. I got into this mess due to finding that stupid love that may or may not come. I have learned my lessons, and it is not for me. I give up and I will not work on it anymore. I must work on securing money and landing a part-time job. I will make myself busy so I do not need it anymore. If anyone would like to date me for some reason, they must work hard to get my attention.

After all this hardship that I experienced last year; I am slowly getting back on track by being a freelancer. After 18 months, I may regain all the money that was lost from me and do plans on migrating to another country. Slowly, I would get to redeem all those hard-earned money to fund the school expenses, accommodations, and airfare costs. I must focus on that money and hope for the best, nothing more. ",No,No,6.5
The causes and effects of COVID-19 on the economy of Thailand,"When the first coronavirus outbreak has occurred, little do we know that this virus will get significantly more critical and become a global crisis at this moment. It is clear to everyone's eyes that the COVID-19 pandemic causes a devastating public health disaster. Still, most of us are entirely unaware of those indirect effects brought by widespread COVID-19. Unfortunately, we are facing one right now, the instability of the economic system. The notable impacts are many services need to be closed, less purchasing power, and more severe income inequality.

We are all amazed by how easy it is to get infected. Consequently, we do fewer social interactions, and that causes loads of closed-contact service to become inactive. Besides, the tourism industry dies because of the prevention of COVID-19. Restaurants, as well as hotels, has to be closed due to the idleness of the tourist.

As mentioned in an earlier paragraph, a bunch of stores has closed during the pandemic. Hence, the available spots for work have been reduced, causing countless workers to become unemployed. Fewer money people made, fewer money people spend. Each individual has inadequate funds, resulting in a dramatic decrease in local purchasing power.

Of course, not only us, a mere group of civilians, are suffering from that difficulty. The government also tried to solve the drop in purchasing power issues using a cash giveaway scheme, which did win the heart of the poor but miserably failed to appease those middle-class. At first glance, it seems to directly focus on the root of the problem by increasing people's funds. However, if we look at the whole picture, the money spent on buying goods are flowing to the bag of the owners of the big company. Those who currently have a lot of influence over the Thailand market are getting more income, while we aren't earning any long-term profit, only around 1500 baht which will wither sooner or later.

In the final analysis, the current economic situation in Thailand is aggravated by COVID-19. The apparent changes are closed stores, lower local purchasing power, and uneven income distribution. It is worth noting that any effects made by COVID-19, whether it is a direct effect or not, should be taken seriously. It is hard to face it as an individual but much simpler when we decided to join force and handle it as a whole. ",No,Yes,6.5
The world has been rapidly changing due to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and it will remain different in many ways.,"The world has been rapidly changing due to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and it will remain different in many ways. Perhaps, one of the most significant changes is the way that people work. Before the pandemic began, the uptake of flexible working was slow and only around 5% of the workforce in the UK were benefited from ways of working flexibly in the pre COVID-19 world (CIPD, 2020), but it has significantly increased at the beginning of the first lockdown to about 45% (ONS, 2020a and 2020b). Although, it is too early to predict the future trend of flexible working based on the current situation, but a recent survey by YouGov (2020) found there are now early signs that many workforces are willing to continue to some degree to work flexibly even when the current restrictions are lifted and the pandemic is over. (144)

Currently, the main questions for a plethora of organisations, such as Leeds City Council, are what will the new post pandemic normal look like and which working practices should be adopted when they are planning to bring their employees back to workplaces. The answers to those question would navigate to identify what changes needed for embracing better ways of working in the “new normal” as well as to maximise the benefit from a balanced flexible working. It is probably fair to say that the new normal workplace for many people unlikely to be as the same one when they will come back to. ",No,Yes,6.5

The experience for many during the pandemic depicts how both employees and employers have rapidly adopted agile working methods and it is now important to take forward the potential benefits and opportunities of this approach into the post pandemic era.

A research by Felstead and Reuschke (2020) revealed that remote working in the UK had a gradual upward trend and nearly tripled from 1. 5% in 1981 to 4. 7% in 2019, but the pandemic has significantly escalated working from home at a rapid pace and since the first lockdown in March 2020, the percentage of people who were working from home suddenly increased. For comparison, it has dramatically grown nearly eight times from 5. 7% in February 2020 to 43. 1% in April 2020. Although, the percentage slightly declined at the end of the first lockdown, but it still remained high at 36. 5% in June 2020.

By the way, it is important to acknowledge that the current style of working from home is not a true picture of what it should be like as many employees need to find a right balance between the working time and other additional responsibilities at the same time due to the current situation such as childcare, home schooling and/or supporting vulnerable loved ones. In addition, working from home in its current form may not be reasonably possible for a long time as some employees are currently suffering from lack of work equipment, suitable place, technology, and/or concentration at their homes.

Although, this is a good opportunity for organisations to review the benefits and opportunities that working from home can offer, but they should also be careful any decisions regarding the future approach shall not be purely based on this experience as there was only a very limited time to evaluate their capability due to the unusual nature of the situation. In addition, working from home is only one type of a wide range of flexible working. There are many types of flexible working and this recent experience was not the usual experience which will be expected from the future options of agile working.

This report will first look at why there is an important need for a post COVID-19 workplace strategy and then, how the required strategy will be prepared, created, and developed in conformity with “the five essential questions at the heart of any winning strategy” (Lafley et al, 2013) in order to help the organisations to benefit from flexible working following the pandemic. Finally, the report will conclude whether adopting a more agile working environment in the long term may be beneficial to both employers and employees. ",No,Yes,6.5

Secondly, vaccination is a form of medication that prepares the body's immune system so that it can combat a disease with which it has not come into contact before. Vaccines are intended to deter illness, rather than treat it until you've got it but it not. However, scientists do not yet know whether the Covid-19 vaccine reduces transmission of the virus or not. The goal of vaccines is to achieve herd immunity in which at least 75% of the population is vaccinated. Before this is accomplished, preventing the spread of the Covid-19 virus should still be executed. Therefore, online learning is still the best solution. ",No,Yes,6.5

Did you travel a lot before Covid-19? What was your favourite destination?,"Covid-19 has definitely changed our lives over the past year. I love to travel and used to do it a lot before the pandemic.

I visited Germany twice during my studies in Switzerland it was amazing. Germany is such a fascinating country with a rich history and beautiful architecture. I have been to Berlin, Cologne, and Dusseldorf and each one has something special about it.

As for United States, the country is so big and has all different cultures combined. When you travel around States it feels like you visit a few different countries. For example Santa Barbara has this Spanish/Mexican vibe because of old-Spanish style architecture and Boston is so British that you forget that you are in the USA. There are so many things to do and places to visit that you need to go there for at least 2 weeks. Also people are so nice and welcoming that you do not want to leave.

Some people are travelling during the COVID-19 restrictions and think that it is completely fine since they do tests before and after their flights. Others think that these people have to be ashamed of travelling since there are cases when tests don’t show the correct result. Discuss both points of view and give your opinion.,"There are some people who believe that COVID-19 restrictions set by governments should not influence their decision on travelling since there are obligatory tests that can stop them from traveling in case they are sick. On the other hand, there are many other people who are convinced that people who travel should feel ashamed because tests might provide wrong results.

People who are convinced that restrictions caused by COVID-19 are not a strong argument for them to pause their life and stop travelling have their point. COVID-19 is a virus that the whole world has to live with. It is not going to disappear no matter what. In fact, life continues and in order to not waste time on the planet, we should continue to live. Moreover, those who decide to travel are taking themselves into danger and are doing all necessary procedures such as PSR tests before and after their flights.

However, those who think that present travellers should be ashamed have their own view on this issue. Currently, despite all lockdowns set in countries, the number of cases is growing enormously. Everyone was confused until they realised that the actual problem hides behind the incoming flights. Foreigners as well as incoming locals spread new variations of COVID-19 around Europe. Additionally, it was proved that even PSR tests are not always correct.

To sum up, there are advantages and disadvantages to both opinions. It is important to not waste your life with the fear of COVID as well as to understand that this virus is not going to disappear. It is simply part of our lives for good. On the other hand, travellers should not be egoistic and think about the resonance of travelling. ",No,Yes,6.5

Some people do not see a problem in traveling if they follow all the rules and do tests before and after their flights. However, tests are not always 100% correct, which leads to the spreading virus and puts a lot of people in danger. Personally, I think that both points are valid, but I would lean toward the latter.

On the one hand, it is understandable why people are okay with traveling if they do have a confirmation that they are healthy. This past year has been challenging for all people around the world. Restrictions changed our life in so many ways and we do not know what to expect from the future. Travelling is something that brings joy and familiarity to people, makes them feel that they can breathe again after being stuck at home for months. So it is not surprising that they take any opportunity to travel as soon as they get it.

On the other hand, it is still extremely dangerous to travel and a medical certificate is not enough. Unfortunately, tests do not always show correct results, so people think that they are healthy and feel free to travel. However, by doing this they put everyone around them in danger. Also, the possibility to get infected is higher in crowded places. Even though airport staff does their best to secure people and follow sanitary rules, it is almost impossible to have social distance.

In conclusion, I understand people’s desire to travel, especially since I have been traveling a lot before Covid-19 and it is suffocating to stay at home for so long. However, I think it is too early to travel yet. Pandemic is the time when people should consider not only themselves but also people around them. It is insensitive and selfish to put everyone around in danger. So it is better to stay home and stay safe. ",No,No,6
Write an essay about advantages and disadvantages of learning by (through) zoom during the time of covid-19 pandemic.,"Due to the appearance of COVID-19, the world has faced an extreme crisis that every field now has to shift to digital platforms, including education. One of the most prefered apps world wide is Zoom, a leading video communication app, which seems to appear with both benefits and drawbacks.

In terms of advantages, Zoom is considered as a great alternative for face-to-face study in the classroom. Firstly, it enables students who are kept in quarantine to study at home with a variety of tools provided in the app such as recording, archiving and sharing features. That allows them to get access to the lesson material at a time of their comfort. Secondly, online learning offers teachers efficient ways to deliver the lesson to students. They can co-edit the project by screen sharing features, or even can use slide, video, pictures for extending the lessons beyonce traditional textbook. Finally, affordability is also one of reasons for Zoom being widely used, because only with a smartphone, students can comfortably learn at any circumstance without additional fees.

However, there are still some disadvantages presented while learning not only through the Zoom app but also on the internet in general. One of the key challenges is internet connection. While internet penetration has grown in leaps and bounds over the past few years, remote areas and mountainous towns have still faced the trouble of inconsistent connection. That results in interruption during class, misunderstanding of knowledge in students, which is detrimental to the education process. Apart from that, students also stand a much greater chance of being distracted from the lessons due to other digital platforms like social media, games. Therefore, supervision from parents is necessary for children to help them concentrate more on the online lesson.

In conclusion, despite some drawbacks, Zoom as well as other online learning apps are the best solution for students and teachers in the matter of finishing the study plans while controlling the spread of viruses. In the future, I believe that online learning will expand even more as a new normal in education after the pandemic. ",No,Yes,6.5
"COVID-19 is a pandemic that has serious impact on human life around the world. In about 500 words, describe what you do as a primary school teacher to help prevent the spread of it.","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused governments to make major decisions about the operation of various economic and social activities. Since the emergence of health emergencies, one of the worst-hit sectors has been preschool education, primary and secondary education. According to the National Assembly’s Culture and Education Committee, since the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 epidemic has had many negative effects on the education sector. Preschoolers, elementary school students and students had to temporarily stop attending school for several months. Many teachers, children, and students have contracted COVID-19. Many important industry tasks cannot be carried out as planned. The long-term closure of schools and education centers, coupled with the impact on the economy and population health, has had an impact on the current and future development of children, especially those living in more vulnerable families. As a result of this crisis, children drop out of school and fall behind in school, food insecurity, abuse, physical and mental health problems, especially the risk of losing their studies, which may have devastating consequences for them, a whole generation. The important thing is that children can continue to learn, and they can learn in an environment that welcomes, respects, tolerates and supports everyone.

Schools and teachers play a vital role in this regard. Sharing accurate information and science-based facts about COVID-19 will help reduce students’ fear and anxiety about the disease and support their ability to cope with any secondary effects in their lives. As a primary school teacher, I realize that schools and teachers play a vital role in this regard. Sharing accurate information and science-based facts about COVID-19 will help reduce students’ fear and anxiety about the disease and support their ability to cope with any secondary effects in their lives. As a primary school teacher, I realize that schools and teachers play a vital role in this regard. Make sure to listen to your children’s concerns and answer their questions in a way that suits their age; don’t overwhelm them with too much information, and encourage them to express and communicate their feelings. Discuss the different feelings they may experience and explain that these are normal responses to abnormal situations. It is also important to emphasize that there are many things children can do to protect themselves and others. For example, introduce the concept of social distance (stand farther with friends, avoid crowds, don't touch others when you don't need them, etc. ). In addition, pay attention to good health behaviors, such as covering with elbows and washing hands when coughing and sneezing. We can perform some scenarios to prove why washing hands with soap for 20 seconds is so important. In addition, we can organize some programs through the Internet to help children understand the basic concepts of disease prevention and control, and use videos or games to show how bacteria spread. For the education sector, it is important to participate in the reopening plan to manage fear and risk perception and build trust. To this end, spaces must be opened up for dialogue with teachers and parent organizations in order to understand their needs and concerns, and can cooperate in establishing mechanisms to ensure the safe reopening of schools. Developing a strategy to ensure that all students have access to learning opportunities is not only critical, but also very urgent.

This crisis has brought huge challenges to the education system in the region. At the same time, it provides an opportunity to rethink the meaning of schools, the basic role of teachers, use technology to promote learning, and establish a solid system to promote the quality of education for all children and young people.

Has COVID-19 more cons than pros?,"No matter how many eras the epidemic is still a frightening thing to people because it is a disease that spreads and makes life difficult. At present, the epidemic that we cannot deny that is the most frightening and dangerous is the Covid-19 disease. Coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, is a new strain of virus that was discovered in 2019 in Wuhan, China. It originated from bats and spread to humans. It can be spread through the air from coughing, sneezing, snot, and touch. The virus can live for up to 9 days and the incubation period for infected people is 7-14 days. In addition, the virus can spread as far as 2 meters, so social distancing is required, wearing masks, washing hands with soap or 75% alcohol or more. to prevent infection. The COVID-19 outbreak has made a difficult to live on everyone. Which we can look at in two ways: it is a benefit in life and it is an impact in life. The first way is that covid can benefit or have the advantage of allowing nature to heal itself. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, people are unable to go out or travel. Therefore, no waste is created and there is no environmental destruction. It came up with the idea of doing something new and making the online play an important role in society. Whether it's studying, working or trading. It also makes people live their lives cautiously. see the importance of protecting oneself from disease and changing lifestyles in more new ways. For the second way, Covid can make impact or disadvantage which has many aspects. whether it be economic, medical and lifestyle. Covid has forced many businesses to close. Or causing some families to go bankrupt because of the epidemic of covid. Making people unable to go out to live and some jobs that can't be done have to cut staff or close the business. It puts doctors, nurses and healthcare professionals at risk of getting the disease from their patients every day. More cases and deaths are caused by inadequate treatment tools and personnel. They had to heal the infected so that some of them had to get infected or, at worst, die. They have to spend time resting and not being with their family. There are also new species born of mutations. causing the treatment to be more tightened. Finally, people have to change their lifestyles according to preventive measures because no one wants to get infected with this disease. Because if the infection enters the lungs, it is at risk of death. Children or people of working age must work from home. When going outside, be careful of the people around you. All of which is said to be what COVID has caused us to face. Everything has its advantages and disadvantages, and so is COVID-19. Even though there are disadvantages that we can hardly see the advantages, but in the end, if we look deeper. We will find its advantages. ",No,Yes,6.5

"In COVID-19 era, more and more classes are being held online all over the world. Do the advantages of this change outweigh the drawbacks?","Today, there is nothing on Earth that has not been affected by the COVID-19 virus, and education is no exception. As you know, education has continued virtually, and this method of online education has many disadvantages and advantages.

In my opinion, online education can save people time. For example, you do not need to use private and public vehicles and spend time in traffic to participate in classes and when fewer people use means of transport, air pollution is reduced to some extent, but what makes online education popular is its availability, so all people can access it as soon as possible

Of course, the disadvantages of virtual education should not be overlooked, because many educational harms are also rooted in online education. It can also express the social harms of online education, such as lack of self-confidence

The conclusion that can be drawn from this text is that virtual education has special advantages and disadvantages, both of which are important, but in my expert opinion, virtual education should be used in addition to face-to-face education.

Online learning had become popular during the COVID-19 pandemic Write an essay of at least 250 words to discuss advantages and disadvantages and give your opinion.,"In the last two years, distance learning has been increasingly popular with students during the Covid-19 pandemic. Many students think this is a good way to develop their learning skills, while others think it isn't as effective as classroom study. This essay will discuss the benefits and drawbacks of online learning.

On the one hand, distance learning without frequent face-to-face interaction with teachers in the classroom is detrimental in two ways. Due to the influence of the Covid-19 epidemic, online students cannot grow as fully as other students when engaging in school classes. Students in online classes have a difficult time making friends or competing with their classmates. In addition, a weak network connection prevents students from learning smoothly and causes them to be interrupted when studying. As a result, online learning is prone to procrastination and is readily distracted by items that divert attention. Furthermore, when studying at home, not everyone has a private room, it will be influenced by the people around you, such as family members' boisterous conversations.

On the other hand, learning online can saving-time us. We don't need to get up early in the morning to be ready for school. Furthermore, we can use Internet resources for test reference. Not only that, but it appears that online learning is more successful than classroom learning. Teachers can effectively communicate teachings to students through online learning. Teachers may utilize all of these assets as part of their lesson plans using online learning, which includes video, PDF, and PowerPoint. Students can get greater insight and broaden their horizons by expanding lesson plans beyond standard textbooks to incorporate internet resources.

In conclusion, I personally believe that online is a new style of learning for today's modern higher education institutions, and that, while it has its drawbacks, it is not a major issue. ",No,Yes,6.5

"Some people agree with Covid-19 vaccination for kids, some don't agree. Discuss both views","Nowadays, Covid-19 has been so fatal to humanity's well-being that scientists have invented vaccines for the virus. However, the vaccination has been a burning issue in Vietnam, for the under-18s in particular. Numerous individuals see eye to eye with this idea, conversely, there are countless opposed to the idea. In this essay, we will be discussing both of the views

To begin with, children without vaccination can be prevented from suffering the aftermaths of the vaccines. Vaccination is very useful however it may bring some deadly aftermaths for specific individuals which may cause serious problems. Namely, countless children have been shown suffering from the symptoms and passed away afterwards. Furthermore, the lack of vaccination may result in the better caution to the virus. It is known that people after being fully vaccinated tend to be more reckless dealing with the virus than before. Recent developments have shown that a higher percentage of humans tend to be heedful towards Covid without vaccination.

However, there are plenty of advantages of vaccinating the juveniles. Firstly, it aids children in going back to school. Most students have been suffering from online learning due to the risk of being infected which can be tackled by vaccinating. For example, schools in specific countries have been able to re-function owing to the high rate of vaccination. Following, getting vaccinated can prevent them from suffering from fatal symptoms. Covid-19 has been evolving over the last 2 year into a potentially fatal virus which is very detrimental to children without vaccination. For instance, a high percentage of individuals without vaccination that are labored under Delta mutation has been shown dead, conversely to those who have been vaccinated thus demonstrating the benefits of inoculation.

All in all, both of the views have their benefits for the well-being of children. However, I believe that vaccination is mandatory for the under-18s",No,Yes,6.5
Changes in workplace practices during the COVID-19,"Covid 19 affect all the sectors on a daily basis of human life. It also changes the workplace system. My justifications are given below.

Covid replaces the workplace with virtual one's. For instance, when the covid outbreak start the government of every country decided to begin the lockdown process due to the increasing spread of Covid 19. The workplace becomes a home office at that time. Every employee of a company starts doing their daily work virtually. The time of office has also changed. When the Covid didn't come, they used to go to their office earlier. As it's based online now they are being lazy to follow the timing.

Many technologies have been made to connect with customers to know their new habits. To illustrate, As customers are being locked in the house, they are using online stuff and shopping a lot. It helps the companies to build new online basis customer service and delivery systems.

The productivity of employees has been changed a lot. Research conducted by Oxford University says that the productivity of employees goes down 50% because of a home office, As employees are being lazy.

Employees are not able to engage in their work like before. The organisation are taking some steps to solve this problem. Such as, they are starting their work by a meeting. So that they can understand the condition of every stuff.

When the Covid 19 will disappear, the employees will come to their daily work at the office. The main problem will be, they won't have the ability or courage to take risks the same as before. It will take much time to repair this.

In my opinion, employees need to be active all the time. If they being slothful, it will slow them in the world race.

To conclude, Covid 19 broke the natural system of the world. It causes a different problem in the workplace sector. We need some activities to follow so that we can deal with it. ",No,Yes,6.5
Topic: How have COVID-19 restrictions and social distancing affected family life?,"Throughout the human era, humankind has undergone a range of deadly diseases, one of which might include the COVID-19 pandemic – the one that we have been through for the time being. The outbreak of this sort of virus has triggered many worrying as well as fears among human beings. For this reason, the government has implemented many approaches as well as has ruled out many restrictions which assuredly have a range of influences on family life both positively and negatively, namely including the following impacts: family’s connection, the quality of life, and the domestic atmosphere.

First and foremost, a bond among family members has been cemented during the COVID-19 pandemic. In other words, it appears that family is far closer to each other than ever before. Under the circumstances, with an aim of defending ourselves against corona viruses, it is essential that regulations, including social distancing, be executed strictly. For one thing, both parents and children are encouraged to study and work at home, which may sound annoying at the outset. Nonetheless, when we spend more time talking and doing many kinds of stuff together, it seems like family bonds will be inclined to get stronger and stronger over time. What is more, we are attached to and get a chance to fully understand one another, which we could not have attained in the past when we were occupied with achieving our own ambitions within the working or academic environment.

In the second place, the quality of life is somewhat diminished due to the consequences that COVID-19 has brought to life. As we knew, when it comes to the present situation, it is evident that some people may not have a chance to continue working anymore, which means that they cannot get as much income as they did in the past. Even in some cases, employees are made redundant and become unemployed; consequently, they will not be able to guarantee their family’s quality of life as usual. It is possible that they could not afford the finest food, or merely the fresh food as they did on account of the dramatic increase of commodity prices. Additionally, not only the food itself but also every sort of product also has a possibility to rise rapidly due to the imbalance between supply and demand. For that reason, without the government’s support, it is undeniably so challenging for citizens themselves to survive in today’s conditions.

Eventually, with the destruction that the COVID-19 pandemic is creating all over the globe, it would be a lie not to mention that this disease has been forming a sort of anxiety that influenced the whole domestic atmosphere. It can be seen on the mass media that the death rate is mounting and the number of cases is surging, which worried everybody, ranging from teenagers to the elderly, in a way that we all cannot concentrate on any of our working stuff on a daily basis. That being said, the mood within family members appears to get worse and worse, not in a way that destroys the bond among them but in a way that affects everybody’s physical and mental well-being. To illustrate this, a lecturer of mine told us that our school has recorded many parents calling and saying that their children are getting much more stressed than ever and cannot focus productively on their academic affairs. Even though our school has implemented dozens of viable solutions in order to sort this out, yet this seems not to work. I suppose that it is not until this disastrous pandemic is over that all of us can manage to get back to our private affairs and effectively work on them.

By and large, I pen down saying that COVID-19 restrictions and social distancing are functioning properly, yet it is unavoidable that all of them have several effects on family life, including on family’s connection, the quality of life, and the domestic atmosphere. Moreover, I’m aware that both the government themselves and each family must take responsibility for fighting against this sort of virus together in order that every citizen can succeed in preserving their health and returning to their normal life.

"When individuals face financial hardships in a lockdown society as a result of the covid-19 epidemic, many people feel that their lives would be great if they were billionaires. Others believe that possessing a lot of money creates more problems than it solves. In my opinion, the negative impact of money is more pronounced, and I will explain why in this post. On the one hand, it is undeniable that having more","We live in a world full with pains, suffering, anguish, and delight. We frequently attempt to make our souls happy through spiritual activities and materialistic pursuits. Few people in society believe that their lives would be better if they were billionaires, while others believe that happiness is unrelated to money. Personally, I completely agree with the latter viewpoint, as I will explain in this essay. On the one hand, having more money unquestionably implies having more options and access to better things and devices. The wealthier a someone is, the more tangible goals they may attain, whether it be housing, food, medications and treatment, education, or anything else. Furthermore, if individuals are able to pay someone to undertake disagreeable tasks, they will be able to spend more time and energy to having fun. Furthermore, it is unfair, yet people respect and enjoy the company of the wealthy more than the impoverished.

On the other hand, there are various reasons why proponents think that riches does not correspond to actual happiness. To begin with, there are many worthwhile things in life that cannot be purchased. People may purchase the best medications and therapies, but not health. Furthermore, pleasure appears to exist independently of money all across the world. People in underdeveloped countries or underprivileged areas of prosperous countries can be as happy as those with a huge bank account. Simple things like family and friends may offer happiness, and the happiest people on the earth think that their lives are meaningful. There are many things in this world that offer us joy, yet some of them cannot be purchased with money.

To summarize, wealth may make life much better and more pleasant, but it is far from all a person requires to be happy, and it can even be a burden at times. Wealth blinds individuals to the genuine worth of things, only seeing how much they cost. Personally, I feel that money provides many benefits to individuals in terms of their status and lifestyle, but it should not be equated as the most important aspect in providing pleasure.

"Write a paragraph of about 150 words about how to protect yourself against COVID – 19. * Note: You are not allowed to include any personal information such as your name, your school’s name, your address, etc. in your writing.","The COVID-19 pandemic has been a part of our daily lives since March 2020, and cases are increasing every day around the world. So we must always be vigilant and know how to protect ourselves from coronavirus. Below are some measures you can take to protect yourself from covid-19. Firstly, keep a physical space of at least one meter between yourself and others, even if they do not appear to be sick, and avoid crowds and close contact because the risks of contracting COVID-19 are higher in crowded and inadequately ventilated spaces where infected people spend long periods of time together in close proximity. Outbreaks have been observed most frequently in places where people congregate, particularly in crowded indoor settings, and where they talk, shout, breathe heavily, or sing, such as restaurants, bars, offices, and so on. Furthermore, when physical separation is not possible and in poorly ventilated circumstances, use a well-fitting mask since the virus can spread from an infected person's lips or nose in microscopic liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing, or breathe, . . . . While wearing a face mask, make sure it covers your nose, mouth, and chin. Please remember to clean your hands before putting on your face mask, before and after removing it, and after touching it at any time. When you remove your mask, place it in a clean plastic bag and wash it if it's a fabric mask, or throw it away if it's a medical mask every day. If you cough or sneeze, cover your mouth and nose with a bent elbow or a tissue. Dispose of used tissues promptly and thoroughly wash your hands. Further, to eliminate bacteria, wash your hands frequently for at least 20 seconds. Although this way will not remove all bacteria from your hands, it will help you avoid dangerous bacteria. Besides, Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth as well, because viruses can spread from your hands to your nose, mouth, and eyes, where they can multiply and cause disease. Additionally, When you stay at home, let’s keep windows open to increase ventilation. If you develop symptoms such as fever, cough, trouble breathing, headache, etc, You need to go to the nearest hospital or clinics in order to declare and test positive for COVID-19, self-isolate until you recover. Currently, in Vietnam, the Ministry of Health has received many batches of anti-coronavirus vaccines from developed countries over the world, and it is distributed evenly across all provinces, communes, and districts in the country. Therefore, you should get vaccinated as soon as it is your turn according to local vaccination guidelines. To summarize, the Coronavirus pandemic is a one-of-a-kind challenge that humanity, in general, and Vietnamese in particular, are dealing with. As a result, in order to protect our health from illness, we must strictly follow the health ministry's anti-epidemic regulations, particularly the 5k rule of the Ministry of Health, which is Masks – Disinfection – Distance – Not Concentration – Medical declaration.

"“The covid-19 pandemic has taken many things from us, but it has taught us some too.” What is your opinion?","The Covid – 19 pandemic and its impacts remain a topic of interest these days. It is sometimes argued that although this crisis poses an unprecedented challenge for humanity, it brings individuals and society good life values. I completely agree with this point of view.

To begin with, the positive effects of the pandemic on individuals are undeniable in modern society. In facing the threat posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, which is one of the health-related diseases, people are deeply aware of the importance of health, which, in turn, pay more attention to their well-being. According to WHO, older people and those with pre-existing medical conditions are at a higher risk of getting coronavirus. Therefore, leading a proactive lifestyle can improve both physical and mental health. Moreover, the covid-19 pandemic stands a chance for individuals to have a new outlook on their life. In other words, the long social distancing time creates many opportunities to think about their actual desires and ambitions that can rarely happen in their life due to financial burdens making them inadvertently ignore their dreams. In this way, personal targets will drive people to accomplish great things in life and free them from the terrible feeling of being lost.

Furthermore, the pandemic partially bears favorable aspects on family and society. Hectic work schedules, by all means, deprive

people of time spent for their family, especially for their children, thus the long break time at home makes it easier for parents to have bonding time with their beloved offspring, promoting a sense of safety, belonging, and understanding. Research shows that 60% of children in American have a feeling of sharing and belonging when expressing their thoughts and emotions with their parents. In addition to the positive impact on family, the pandemic is time for connecting the community. Indeed, people can build trust, compassion, gratitude, and respect toward meaningful actions in the difficulty of the epidemic.

In that context, according to many experts, the vaccine passport can be the basis for us to rebuild exchange activities and break the freeze of many economic sectors while the pandemic is still ongoing. The vaccine passport is also considered a serious way to promote tourism and international exchanges. If passengers have vaccine passports, they do not need or are isolated for a short time, do not require testing to create favorable conditions for guests. Technological solutions are needed to accurately track people's movements, meet data privacy and security standards, and enable the exchange of information between countries. ",No,Yes,6.5
The percentage of overweight children in western society has increased by almost 20% in the last ten years. Discuss the causes and effects of this disturbing trend.,"A drastic alleviation in number of overweight children has been observed over the last decade. In the modern time, obesity in children has seen a surge of almost 20%. There are several reasons contributing to this as well as it’s potential effects.

Lifestyle choices has led to the emerging issue of obesity in children in western society. Not following a healthy diet is one of the major and important reason for significant increase in the weight. For example, consumption of packed food instead of cooking fresh and healthy meals at home has been an easy and convenient way for children while their mothers are away. Another cause of the problem is lack of exercise. Playing video games on computers and mobile phones have been the first preference of teenagers rather than playing outdoor games in free time. Since there is no or very less body movement, the consumption of calories is very low.

Such a lifestyle can have major effects on the health of the children in long-term. A rise in weight has been observed as the main reason behind many diseases. For instance, diabetes, high cholesterol and so on are faced by people suffering from weight issues. Apart from this, low self-confidence has also been a result of obesity in most of the children. Physical appearance is a confidence booster for all, especially as a child, since people tend to bully fat students.

Poor lifestyle choices like consumption of less nutritious food and not working out has certainly contributed to an increase in percentage of children suffering from overweight. If not properly taken care of, this could result in health problems in the future which can prove to be a disadvantage for the society. ",No,Yes,6.5
Agrowing number of overweight people is putting a strain on the health system to deal with the health problems.

Certain people argue that providing curriculum in school to deal with the problem. This essay agree that insert lessons in curriculum of school because this suggestion would be benefit people health in general, and it would have a positive impact on the shape of their body.

There is some truth in the argument that providing section of health in curriculum can be helpful students to be more care about their health and they might be fit. However, I think the lessons would be about kind of healthy food and cardio exercies. This is because many food are cause of obesity, but exercies are also the cause. I think, unless people should know about this issue earlr in the school throght the lesson, individual might face heavy problems in the future. This means that, although exist asustance provide energy to the body, there is also a food which contain of alot of fat, which is the main cause of obesity. Moreover, Another reason why I believe that teaching about obesity in curriculum of school is that lake of walking. The majority of individuals are sedentary, for they watch tv for along hours. Thus, people becoming overweight. This is because they don't care about size of the problem, and it is effect. For instance, according to a recent report by the Guardian newspaper shown that in the USA there have been an increase in the amount of adolescent obesity, which was the result of many years. In conclusion, despite there are people who feel that curriculum don't need additional like heath section, I do not agree, as this would be a beneficial step and it could be a healthy community empty from disease.

There are various reasons for the rise in the overweight population which can be addressed and solved to decrease this incidence.

There are many reasons for the increasing obesity, and one of the major cause is, reduction in physical activity. Most of the office jobs offer a sedentary environment with long working hours and people have less time for physical exercise and sports, which leads them to gain weight.

Secondly, educating people about healthy food choices and the availability of healthy and nutritious meals in the cafeterias and supermarkets can help us lower the risk of obesity and obesity-related diseases.

The percentage of overweight children in western society has increased by almost 20% in the last ten years. Discuss the causes and effects of this disturbing trend.,"Over the last ten years, western societies have seen close to a 20% rise in the number of children who are overweight. This essay will discuss some reasons why this has occurred and examine the consequences of this worrying trend.

The main cause of this problem is poor diet. Over the last decade there has been a prolific increase in the number of fast food restaurants. For example, on nearly every high street there is a MacDonald’s, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Pizza Hut. The food in these places has been proven to be very unhealthy, and much of the advertising is targeted at children, thus ensuring that they constitute the bulk of the customers of these establishments. However, it is not only due to eating out, but also the type of diet many children have at home. A lot of food consumed is processed food, especially with regards to ready-made meals which are a quick and easy option for parents who are working hard.

The effects of this have been and will continue to be very serious. Firstly, there has been a large increase in health related diseases amongst children, especially diabetes. This debilitating illness means a child has to be injected with insulin for the rest of their life. Not only this, very overweight children often experience bullying from other children, which may affect their mental health. The negative stigma of being overweight may also affect self-esteem.

The number of people who are at risks of serious health problems due to overweight is increasing. What is the reason for the growth in overweight people in society? How can this problem be solved? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Recent decades have witnessed an enormous growth of the obesity epidemic in many developed countries. There is not the slightest doubt that people`s health status will be seriously threatened by this issue. This essay will illustrate the main factors contributing to obesity problems and thereby elicit some feasible solutions.

Firstly, current research has blamed the increasing overweight population on the ubiquitous junk food. You are what you eat. In order to be fit, one needs to eat healthily. Excessive fat, which is hardly digested has been regarded as the major reason for obesity. Secondly, by spending more time on TV programs and browsing the internet, people have fewer opportunities to participate in sports activities. The accumulated calories would be expended only if one does enough physical exercises. Last but not least, convenient transportation intensifies this situation. Trains and automobiles are the favorable commuting methods of urban citizens. When walking and running are excluded from modern lifestyles, more and more people have to face overweight issues.

Thus a combination of unhealthy food, lack of physical exercise, and modern lifestyle has contributed to the rise in obesity problems amongst people. However, every cloud has a silver lining, governments should take the responsibility to help people escape from the obesity dilemma. To begin, the production and sales of junk foods should be strictly constrained, especially to adolescents. On top of that, public service advertisements about healthy diet and physical exercises should be released through TV channels and various websites. Furthermore, local councils should organize more sports events, pine participants' interests, and provide them with an incentive to do more physical practices such as walking, running, and cycling.

Henceforth, it can be confidently concluded that the growth of obesity has significant relevance to the modern lifestyle. Governments are committed to guiding citizens to a healthy situation because health is wealth. ",No,No,6.5
The growing number of overweight people is putting a strain on the health care system in an effort to deal with the health issues involved. Some people think that the best to deal with this problem is to introduce more physical education lessons in the school curriculum. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The soaring trend of the obese people is a crucial concern for the whole health care system and some people who think for solutions like increasing physical-education related subjects in the schools. The whole train of thoughts in this article totally disagrees with the mentioned solution. I believe that this method will rob youngsters of a prosperous prospect and has no effective impact on current society.

Juveniles need to learn a wide variety of hands-on skills, at which they can excel in their future life, during their education period. This fact involves having a myriad of school disciplines ranging from mathematics to social sciences in their curriculum, which fills a chief proportion of their available time. Focusing on just one part of vital skills such as athletic subjects will undoubtedly result in a generation addicted to sports and will deprive this generation of planning and developing a glorious life.

Although having an active life for adolescents will lead to a physically-active generation, it has no tangible impact on current overweight folks. Thus, I guess that the best initiative for encouraging this part of society to have an energetic life-style instead of a sedentary one is promotion of daily-based work-out benefits, devastating effects of obesity on physical well-being, and the challenges of public health care system pertinent to handling this crisis on the media.

Overall, the health care system will not witness a low workload unless whole society, not just part of it, get informed about the burdens they are imposing on health service, and the fact that with respect to the obesity ""The prevention beats the treatment"". ",No,Yes,6

Discuss the causes and effects of this disturbing trend.,"-Nowadays, obesity in children is becoming a significant area of concern. The upsurge in percentage of overweight children in western society is detrimental to oneself as well as for the community.

Furthermore, there are various causes associated with overweight. Firstly, the most vital cause is advanced technology. Although this enhanced technology is beneficial for society, children are misusing it.

Although there are some root causes behind this issue, effective policies can be adapted to remedy this situation. In this essay, I will explore some of the causes associated with this problem and propose some solutions.

To begin with, I believe the individuals who have obesity are to blame. Firstly, each person has specific eating habits which can cause problems like overweight. Take junk food consumption by some people as an example; this food could be damage individuals' health in the long run. Adding to the suffering is that the hectic lifestyle that an enormous number of people experience in modern societies could be one of the primary causes of this matter.

Firstly, parents could instill the value of a healthy diet in their children, broadening their children's horizons; they can be sure that their beloved ones know the consequences of unhealthy eating habits. Secondly, the federal government could furnish the towns and cities with free sports centers and gyms, which are specialized for obese people. Over the long haul, with the help of these solutions, almost every community can tackle the obesity problem.

Travelling abroad is comfortable to approach than in the past era for many reasons. On the one hand, there are plenty of advantages regarding aboard travelling.

Is is better to do unpaid work in their free time is better . Do you think it’s advantage overweight it’s disadvantages,"A few people believe that adolescents must be encouraged to participate in unpaid social service during their free time as it would be beneficial for both teenagers and the society. I disagree with this view and I will defend my stand with valid arguments in this essay.

To begin with, if teenagers are required to volunteer for unpaid community services, some people think that it would enhance their feeling of empathy towards mankind and nature. As teenagers are highly impressionable, working for the community will turn them into socially responsible adults. So, for the benefit of the community and teenagers, teenagers must be encouraged to occupy themselves with voluntary work in their free time.

However, children between thirteen and nineteen years of age are fragile and through community work, they have to dig deep into the harsh realities of life such as hunger and poverty. This could adversely affect their young conscience and they would be carrying the negative image of society in their minds throughout their lives. Also, if the work is unpaid, there is a lack of motivation as well because if they are not paid for their efforts, they may get discouraged to participate in future. For example, many children are devastated when they interact with the deprived segment of the society and sometimes this leads to serious cognitive issues like depression and phobia of meeting new people. Therefore, it should not be mandatory for the teenagers to take part in unpaid social work in their free time. ",No,No,6.5
"Cause and effect essay: A problem of modern societies is the declining level of health, especially gaining weight of the general population. Researchers are warning people with the facts that obesity can bring serious problems such as depression and heart-related diseases. In this essay, we will discuss the possible causes and effects of being overweight.","In my opinion, one of the main reasons why people get obese is eating junk food and a sedentary lifestyle. Nowadays, the number of people who working day and night is constantly increasing, so they do not have any leisure time to cook by themselves. In order to save some time to work, they prefer to order a cheap meal from fast-food restaurants, such as MacDonalds, KFC and etc which after what, they consume more fats, carbohydrates than they would cook by themselves. Because, scientists proved that, if a person cook from natural ingredients, the number of fats will be considerably fewer than in restaurants.

Also, the next reason for this problem is a sedentary lifestyle without any physical activities. Now, people to relax choose sitting in front of the TV instead of doing sport. It has been proved that during the sport, it is so much oxygen carried to the brain, after which you will feel yourself cheerfully. But when we are collapsing near the TV, we burn fewer calories than we consume, as a result, of course, we are starting to gain the pounds.

As the possible effects of this problem, we can consider some health problems and loss of productivity. First of all, obesity results in incorrect functioning of the body and contributes to the risk of developing some chronic diseases. For example, as body fat percentage increases, the person's metabolism worsens, which in turn may result in diabetes or heart diseases.

Secondly, overweight people are very unhealthy and often suffer from stress and tiredness. This lessens their work capacity and results in lower productivity. For example, it has been proven that an obese person needs to put more effort to complete some task than a person with normal weight.

To sum up, obesity is a big problem that affects a lot of people nowadays. It’s mainly caused by inactive lifestyle and eating disorders and results in severe health problems and loss of productivity. ",No,Yes,6.5

Within the scope of this writing, an attempt will be made to look at the causes for this trend and put forward some solutions.

One of the most serious issues is that individuals do not eat nutritious foods. This means that instead of eating nutritious foods like vegetables, fruit, or fish which contain vitamin C, D, A, and other nutrients, they eat fast food, especially for children. The answer is that parents should teach their children about the negative effects of junk food, such as heart-related diseases

Another cause is that citizens do not routinely take part in outdoor activities. They sleep instead of exercising because they don't have enough time, their work or their children make them tired. Perhaps, young people believe that they are in good health and exercise is a waste of time. In addition, rather than participating in sports, they spend their leisure time playing video games, surfing the internet, Facebook, or watching television. To solve this problem the governments should construct public parks with modern equipment so that inhabitants may exercise and talk together. This not only helps their health to be more adequate but also reduces their stress after work or study.

In conclusion, although eating an unhealthy diet and not participating in outdoor activities regularly are the two problems of this trend, improving the awareness of children by educating them and building public parks with state-of-the-art facilities are the possible ways to address the situation.

"At the present time, the large and number of young adults, compare with the number of older people. Situation overweight the disadvantages situation","As it is seen in a number of countries, the number of old population are lower than the young individuals. This situation has some disadvantages nevertheless and number of benefits. Without any doubt, I completely believe that the advantages overweight the drawbacks.

First of all, the young adults will face a major disadvantage and it is the lack of experience. People gain experience from the mistakes they make and new generations often kam found off problem which are new for them but not for the old people. For instance, there was a earthquake in our area when everyone was panicked, mother and father remained calm and leaded everyone out of their home safely. Experienced person can help Nation from any bad situation where you can easily lost their focus.

Even though the disadvantage is massive, the advantages not less than that. The energy and innovative mentality can help one Nation to prosper and overcome several problems. The old members of society are always try to stick with the traditional way but young do not fear to try something new. For example, the advancement of technology are all thanks to the mentality of youngs. Young people use technology for making life easy which are very visible. From the invention of light to the invention of internet all are created by young's energy and foolishness.

To conclude, the young can gain experience from mistakes which make the drawback more little which means if the population of young are more than the old, it is a blessing for that country. ",No,Yes,6.5
The number of people who are at risk of serious health problems due to being overweight is increasing. What are the reasons behind increasing weight by people? What are the possible solutions?,"The list of persons who are in danger of critical health issues due to obesity is bolstering. There are plenty of reasons for this situation and steps are needed to control the excess fat accumulation by the people. There are two main reasons behind gaining weight by individuals. Firstly, the availability of junk food outlets across the street, and advertisement related to unhealthy cuisines such as burgers and pizzas, attract kids and youngsters. Secondly, lack of physical activity due to a sedentary lifestyle. For instance, even visiting the nearest place people make use of vehicles instead of walking. Finally, imbalance in sleeping schedule either due to stress or job-related satisfaction also contributes to increased body weight. There are certain solutions to tackle this problem. To begin with, toxic food advertisement needs to be banned. In addition, high taxes must be imposed on oily junk food, consequently, the middle class will hesitate to buy. Also, gyms and cycling are to be promoted. Furthermore, the proper nutritious diet plan is to be made by referring to a dietitian. Last but not least, working hours ought to be set up to improve sleep patterns. In conclusion, there are several factors of increasing body fat, but this can be resolved by possible solutions and guidance. ",No,Yes,6.5
What are the causes and effects of being overweight?,"The recent years are witnessing an alarming growth in the number of overweight people. It is extremely easy to find the main causes and effects this phenomenon has on daily life.

In my opinion, the foremost causes of overweight are inactive lifestyle and unhealthy eating habits. Today more and more people rely on cars instead of walking, have less physical demands at work and prefer inactive leisure activities. This results in burning fewer calories and gaining weight. Secondly, it is undeniable that those who consume fast food gain weight much faster than those who don’t. With the consumption of fried food moving in tandem, fat will accumulate, assemble, and is gradually hard to be got rid of. Thus, an inactive lifestyle and eating fast food are the two most important causes of overweight.

The main effects stemming from these reasons are health-related diseases. Including heart diseases, diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke, and some types of cancer. Those kinds of diseases will certainly make them feel a struggle in their life. For example, the majority of people with diabetes and high blood pressure in Vietnam and other ASEAN countries are considered to be the main influences of overweight. In addition, being overweight also causes the body to become oversized, so it causes feelings of inferiority and stress for overweight people themselves.

To sum up, overweight is a big problem that affects a lot of people nowadays. It’s mainly caused by inactive lifestyle and eating disorders and results in severe health problems and loss of confidence. ",No,Yes,6.5
the best way to deal with problems related to overweight is by introduce more physical education lessons in the school curriculum,"Due to the increasing number of people who suffer from obesity, most of the health systems around the world are stressed, because of dealing with this issue in addition to another ones, and for this reason, there is a thought that this problem can be solved by introducing more physical subjects for students at schools. In my opinion, education people through specific programs and supporting these by governments is more essential.

In most cases, educating students with lessons related to health is not sufficient alone as they need to be mentored all the time not just at schools. Thus, certain programs can be established for this purpose to educate the people and provide them with the needed physical trainings. Some organizations, for example, can be prepared with experienced trainees and supported with materials to make them ready to help obesity people.

Also, governments play an important role in supporting such programs. One of the supportive things, that could be done, is funding these organizations and training centers. In this way, after a certain period of time, the taken procedures will enhance the community's health, for instance, by removing the burden on the hospitals, which have been occupied with obesity issues.

In conclusion, just teaching the students more subjects to maintain their health is not a good approach as they need an appropriate supervision to guarantee that they have considered what they learnt. For this reason, I believe that the population need to be educated and mentored by specialized persons and the people in the governments could contribute in avoiding problems related to obesity by support and establish the needed programs.

some reasons lead to overweight and malnutrition,"Overweight

I will talk about some reasons that make us overweight. First of all, we consume too much junk food and sweets such as fried chicken, hamburgers or something which are made by chemicals like fish balls, shrimp balls or milk tea. Nowadays, due to the development of food and drinks stores as well as teenager necessaries, the average number of obese people increases quickly. Second, lack of exercise is also a cause of fat accumulation. Almost all teenagers don't like to do exercises because they could study hard and spend their free time on entertainment. They use a lot of weight loss functional medicine instead of doing exercises because it helps us lose weight very fast and easier. However, they underestimate the harmful effects of taking drugs and they rely too much on them. In the past, I used to be overweight due to eating too many sweets. I'm addicted to eating and I must eat a lot to lose weight, but I totally don't do exercise because of laziness, so I gained weight uncontrollably. It's very hard and makes me bored. However, I am always scared of body shaming, so I decided to force myself to change the negative thoughts of everybody.

Malnutrition
Malnutrition is a common condition in some people in society. It comes from a lot of reasons, but I will give you some main reasons that lead to this. First, digestive disorders when they eat anything. This is a disease that makes people poorly absorb foods, or lose their appetite and can't eat much. This leads to a lack of energy and nutrients for the body to function properly. Second, due to low economic conditions, some poor countries such as Central Africa, Nigeria, perhaps face poverty and lack of food every year, so most of the people were malnourished and suffered from severe food poisoning.

"overweight in childern is a problem nowadays, some people claim that government have to take full responsibility for this problem. in what extent do you agree or not agree?","In recent years, obesity has become increasingly / one of the most serious health problems among people of all ages, especially children. While some people claim that the government should take full responsibility to find the solution for this problem, there are those who believe that parents and shools also play an important role in dealing with the issue and I also agree with this.

On the one hand, there are several solutions on this problem that the authority should consider. First, the government may have some advertise campaigns about the negative effects of obesity to raise the public’s awareness. By this way, people will be encouraged to have an active, healthy lifestyle. Second, advertisements on foods and drinks that contain high sugars and fat should be restricted on TV and other mass media.

On the other hand, parents and school are also responsible for maintaining low level of overweight among their children. One of the main causes of obesity and unhealthy in children is the choice of daily diet by their parents. A healthy nutritional balanced diet is necessary for every single child to grow up normally without any serious diseases. In addition, as the lack of physical exercises can also lead to an obese child, an amount of physical sessions should be held weekly by schools for their young students to keep fit and stay healthy.

In conclusion, childhood obesity has become a rising issue in modern society, but I strongly believe that it can still be controlled if the government, parents and schools get together to help our young generation. ",No,Yes,6.5
A rise in childhood obesity is a real threat to health with an increasing number of children now classed as overweight. What are the causes of the problem and what measures can be taken to solve them?,"The problem of children’s weight gain which was always debatable has now become more controversial with many claiming that it is hazardous. This health issue is due to many factors such as lack of exercise and feasibility of junk food. However, there are number of favorable solutions to tackle this problem.

The major contributing factor to child’s obesity is being less active. This stems from the advancement of technology, and children staying for long hours in front of smartphone scree or playing online video games. Many steps could be taken to solve this issue one lies on the shoulder of parents and the other on schools. Parents certainly should limit screen time as recommended by health organization in correspondence with their ages. Moreover, educational institutes should increase the hours of physical education, teach and encourage students the imports of daily physical activities to stay fit and healthy.

Another contributing factor to children being overweight is the ease of having junk food nowadays. In other words, rapid food is widely spread and can be bought with a click on phone with cheap prices compared to healthy food. Furthermore, even schools started to sell junk food on campus looking for more profit. There are some obvious solutions to this problem. Firstly, government should impose more taxes on junk food making this less attractive to buy. Secondly, schools should prohibit selling or having junk food on their campuses. In addition, nutrition classes could be given to further emphasize on the significance of healthy life style.

In conclusion, children’s obesity is a trending problem recently due to many reasons such as activity reduction and availability of fast food. However with the correct approach done by parents, schools and authorities the issue must come to an end. ",No,No,6.5

As the social life of children is developing they encounter more social problems with their bosom friends that they need experience to handle them. (topic sentence) although being a part social community is an inevitable case not all problems can be solved as there is no enough experienced grossed parents are older and more experienced that they can easily guide their children to develop long-lasting friendships. children can ameliorate their friendships by learning new things from their parents. Being an adult I remember how harder it would be for me to establish friendships without the assist of my parents. As financial crisis is developing, without a help adult-who were once children-must be able to handle their financial probmels. handling difficulties in life origins from the hard times that a person encounters as a young individual since being a child a person is more tolerant and has more chance to risk thus they know the right way to solve money problems.

"What cause an increasing in the number of overweight children, and how to solve","The number of children that are overweight which could occur various issues regarding to both of the children's health and the health care expenses in future to come. In my opinion, children gain weight by having only unproductive things for exants, Candies, ice-cream including junk foods. In order to fill the bill, parent or guardian should keep an eye on children and limit the amount of junk food that kids taken in daily life.

In my way of thinking children these days have eaten a great amount of junk food that contains a number of carbohydrates and fats, moreover, they don't exercise enough to burn calories. Nowadays, parents spoiled their kids by let them have what they want.

Moreover, guardians are not concerns about future health expenses

that their children will be responsible for.

Nevertheless, as being a parent, parent should has their own way in order to deal with your kids since children are too young to consider what is good or bad by themselves. As school plays an important role in children's life,

school and teachers must keep in touch with students with the purpose of limiting carbohydrates taken in certain meals.

In addition, schools should provide daily exercise for students to lose weights and also contribute a healthy diet lesson to students.

Ultimately, In order for children to lose weight, they need parents or guardians to help them accomplished a goal by monitoring their own kids and making sure that they will not face both health and healthcare costs in a few years to come. ",No,Yes,6
"Now days, overweight became a serious problem over the world, this has a negative effect on the level of health and fitness. In this essay I will address the problem with the common reasons and solutions.","Nowadays, being overweight became a serious problem over the world, this hurts the level of health and fitness. In this essay, I will address the problem with common reasons and solutions.

There is no doubt that being overweight is a critical problem, and every country should encounter it because it affects people’s productivity and also their health. There is a conflict relation between the overweight and the level of health and fitness. In other words when people become fat their health and their fitness get worse. Many reasons lead to gaining unhealthy weight, for instance, unhealthy food. This industry is growing quickly, as a result of the pushing from advertisements. Another major reason is not practicing any kind of sport, there is a wide range of people do not even have enough time to do that, in addition, that some places do not have enough facilities to let people do exercises. With being Overweight some illnesses such as diabetes arise, as a consequence, the health system expenses a huge amount of money on patients.

Although it is not an easy problem to get solved, it is important to work on the causes to make sure that the people have a better life. While others see it as the Governments role, I see there is an undeniable role in the community, to illustrate, The Government can put restrictions on the food, and also they can set requirements on the goods. In addition, they can acknowledge people with the harmful of unhealthy food. There is another area that the government should focus on which is the availability of sports areas. If the government did that, it would lead to a healthy generation, and this would lead to making savings in the health system.

In conclusion, being overweight is a serious problem that should be solved as I illustrated the unhealthy food and the lack of sports facilities are the main reasons, and they should be tackled, however, the community has a significant impact on the result, but the government is the corn stone and they should give strong attention for the problem.

"Some people think that the government should provide assistance to all kinds of artists including painters, musicians and poets. However, other people think that this is a waste of money. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Many people lives are richer because of their art which they express to community. Many individual believe that the government should provide funds to artist while other believe that it is unfair. This essay analyse both the perspectives.

To begin with former views, there are many points that authority should help artists. Artists are contribute to nation by their art. Creativity is having in every person by their born but to elaborate it is a vital thing for any individual and all artist do that. At the end, they serve their creativity to their community for entertain perpose. Additionally, artist represent their culture by their art so, they become ambassador of their nation. For an example, painters represent their art by emboss as well as sculpture represent by carving and engraving and could be popular worldwide and express their tradition.

Moving to a latter view counter of former view having a strong reasons. Government should firstly focus on basic need for developing country. Individual's primary need is accommodation shelter and food yet, many individual has not get it. For well being life of human is a foremost priority for authority and still thye focus on other art instead this primary things. Additionally, they should also focus on infrastructure development. Nation want to add their name in developed country, foremost of it is developed their urban, ruler and their transportation by providing more found in it.

The idea of having single career option is becoming old fashioned one. The new fashion mil be to have several career or way of earning money and further education will be something that continuous throughout life.,"The perception of having only single career becomes outdated now. The new goal is to have numerous career option to generate passive income and to implement life long learning.

I am very truly agreed with the above mentioned statement. Because today's world demands to be entrepreneur. As the old method to study and getting jobs doesn't works anymore. For example if a student is studying in the stream of business. He prefers to generate passive income from number of sources, as internet provides a lot of opportunities to earn without doing a lot of hustle bustle.

On the hand it is necessary to have two or more career options because sometimes you are unable to earn that much from a single source to fulfill your desires. Also the modern world has lot of opportunities but difficulties to. And if a person is depends upon a single career and he or she if loses his job, then this might be impossible from him to survive for longer period of times. Although the modern era demands us to implement life long learning throughout our life. As new technology is upgrading day by day. And we have to develop our skill set accordingly. For example: if you are a shopkeeper, the old methods of selling products doesn't works anymore, people wants everything at there ease and he or she will nit going to wait for longer period to buy something from the shop. Therefore the shop keeper has to use his critical thinking skills and sell it's products with ease by converting his shop to grocery store which will relax him and his customers too. To conclude that i would say that I am fully agreed that a single career option doesn't works anymore. And a person has to think to generate income from numerous sources. We have to enhance our skill set thorough out our life and implement it in our business or work",No,Yes,6

This means that they already have sacrified a lot in order for us to become successful adults and one of the minimal things that we could do is appreciate them. Besides this we need to maintain this kind of behaviour around them because they always were beside us during difficult times so we can feel at ease again and get a hold of ourselves. No matter how you see it they have done a great deal of things for us so respecting them is a must. Obviously, there are a lot of ways to show your respect one of which is to help them do things they are not able to do anymore like lifting heavy objects. We could also provide them with food and medicine when nessecery just like they did it for us when we were young to show them that we appreciate what they have done through all these years. And last but not least is to make sure when we don't see them to call them so they can feel loved and that there are people that care for them.

"A person's worth nowadays seems to be judged according to social status and material possessions,old fashioned values such as kindness,honour and trust no longer seem important.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?","Today, wealthy and influential people get more accolades of members of the society than people with noble character. While l agree that self importance is attributed to social class and how rich a person is, l do not agree individuals with good integrity are considered less significant in the society.

On the one hand, being affluent command respect and acceptance by community members as majority of people believe only the rich can take up leadership role in key political positions. Furthermore, judging individuals worth based on the magnitude of their material possession affect contributions to the growth and development of the community in which they reside. A good example of this is the wealthy people voted for based on their social contributions to their community in 2019 election in Nigeria to occupied various political post.

However, I disagree with the idea that people of reputable quality are less essential this day as they used to be in time past. Just as material possession is important so also is a man's integrity in today's society. People of good moral standard serves as role model for generation to come. Equally, individuals with good character impact others positively more especially the youths. For instance, parents of high moral standard influences their children in a positive way to be good children just like them.

In conclusion, although members of the society value and respect people due to their material possession, I believe that people of good uprightness are still considered more crucial and hold in high-esteem in the society. ",No,Yes,6.5
The idea of having a single career is becoming an old fashioned one. The new fashion will be to have several careers or ways of earning money and further education will be something that continues throughout life.,"Nowadays it is very common that people pursue more than occupation. People are now attracted in different professions to make healthy savings. Basically, there are two main reasons lie in this fact. One cause is, the ever-changing technology and the other one is financial conditions. Consequently, people are eager to learn and develop new skill sets to adopt to the new living conditions.

Science and Technology opens a new avenue in modern life. It has a greater ripple effect on every humankind. This improvement has changed the thought process and attitude of every working individuals. The impact of technological change are enormous. It pairs very well between the labor and capital to generate revenue. For example, the automobile industry uses the computer programs to improve the fuel efficiency. Many other inventions have similar effects. Not only it creates new job scope, it also allows people to learn different field work and excel simultaneously. From a recent survey, it is revealed that, more than 100 skill centers are created in every town due to raising job positon and demand from people to take multiple courses.

On the other hand, soaring competition also encourage people to explore more than one area. Job security is no longer guaranteed in any organization. People may lose job anytime and to protect themselves from such catastrophic effect, they are working two or three jobs. For example, a sales man not only works as marketing executive but also a real-estate agent. A computer engineer may run a blog on free time to make extra savings for his family. Hence, the fact is very clear that, there is no one want to risk or take chances on their financial security and stability. The evolution of internet and telecommuting is inevitable which motivate people to be more enthusiastic and work from anywhere without quitting their full-time job.

To conclusion, growth of technology and financial instability are the factors to drive people to pursue multiple careers. The availability of new roles in the market just made easily accessible for them. ",No,Yes,6.5

This gesture shows good behavior and discipline. In my opinion it is very important to demonstrate respect to the elderly people for many reasons, which many of them will be examined below.

To start with, in my country Greece the demonstration of respect to the old people is something that someone can be find in every family and in every person’s principals, with very little exceptions. We believe that this is very important for them because as time goes by they get older and they feel more lonely and disappointed, so what we have to do is to show them our love and appreciation. Moreover, it is a usual phenomenon that when the parents are in work they call their kids’ grandparents to keep an eye on them until they come back. I believe that this is a very serious reason to respect our grandparents and generally the elderly people

There are many ways to show our respect to an old person. In case he is a relative of us, we can show our respect and love by giving him a kiss or call him for a dinner. Furthermore, a good option is to buy him a gift that he was always wanted. Also if we see someone old enough who cannot pass the driveway, it will be great for him to help him pass easy and safe. Last but not least we should avoid talking to them baldly and not paying attention to them because they feel sad something that is very bad for an old person.

To end up I deeply believe that we must show respect and have time with the elderly people because they deserve it and that will make happy not only us but the old person too. ",No,Yes,6.5
"It is commonly believed that nowadays main factors that affect a child's development are media, pop culture and friends. A different point of view is that family plays the most significant role. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","A person's personality is formed under the influence of family upbringing and external factors. Some people argue that external factors such as peer, media and teacher pressures have more effect on children temper than family. This essay will discuss both these points of view and argue in favour of the latter.

One the one hand, The books children read and the music they listen, form their beliefs and faiths. In other words, children tend to follow and imitate the behaviour of their favourite personality. Moreover, when a children are in school or play in playground, they are influenced by their peers. Finally, other factors, like the media, prompt children to want things regarded as fashionable. For instance, children demand toys that they see on television. Therefore, some people argue that external factors have an undeniable influence on the life of children and are predominant in shaping their future.

On the other hand, a child's personality is malleable at a very young age, and parents are often present in their life at this stage. Also, very young children love to imitate their parent's behavior. For example, children who have a dysfunctional family often exhibit behavioural problems at school. That is while, An emotionally safe home environment is critical for the child's confidence. Moreover, parents also teach children about setting boundaries. It is their behavior and upbringing that teaches children what friends to choose, what books to read, and what movies to watch.

Therefore, In my opinion, children's choice of friends, books or music and etc. depends on the values inspired in them by their parents. Therefore, parents hold more substantial mastery over their offspring than media, pop culture and friend groups.

In conclusion, it is undeniable that the outside world affects the intellectual and social development of children. However, I believe that it is the parents who, from a very young age, provide the ground for the positive or negative direction of these developments. ",No,Yes,6.5
In the past people wore their traditional clothes and followed their culture. These days most people wear similar clothes and therefore look very similar to one another. Do you think this is a positive or a negative development?,"These days, people’s perspectives on the value of clothing are changing, and individuals tend to wear similar clothing compared to people in the past who opted for their traditional clothing. I believe this tendency exerts a positive influence on the society.

It is certainly true that there are some drawbacks to this tendency because it may lead to a loss of global diversity. It can be argued those who wear ordinary clothes such as T-shirts and jeans cannot feel a connection to their roots, and they are likely to neglect their culture and the contribution of their ancestors. Therefore, these people may not take pride in their region, and they might migrate to an urban location rather than contribute to the development of their community. Consequently, many ethnic minorities could suffer from the depopulation and eventually disappear.

However, I believe that there are more positives than negatives in people opting for similar clothes. The first explanation is that individuals can feel a sense of unity with people all over the world even though they have different religions and ways of life. This mind would motivate people in the world to support one another, instead of thinking that different parts of the world should deal with their own problems when natural disasters and other terrible problems occur in different nations. Furthermore, this tendency is economically profitable. Generally speaking, as ordinary clothes are automatically manufactured, they can be produced faster and more affordably than traditional clothing such as Japanese Kimono, which is hand-crafted.

In conclusion, although people today tend to wear similar clothes instead of traditional ones and this trend will cause several problems, I believe that the society as a whole can reap more benefits of this tendency. ",No,Yes,6.5

This message is good to motivates children in real life, that they must to work harder to raise what they want. But sometimes there are situation that make this message have negative impact for children.

From the one side, this message is useful for everyone especially for children, cause this message told them to be more productive in their live, doing a good activity and always have a positive thinking on the future of their live. After take the message the children will applied the message in their activity, make them always encourage their skill and do a positive activity. Example, when this message is giving to the children, especialy who want to be a soccer players in the future, so this message will always support them to practice to play soccer every day. And when he down, he will remember this message and it can make them up again to doing more practice.

On the other side, giving children this message have negative impact in some situations. As we know, that it is not always easy to raise or get what we want in the world. Especially when we grow in mature, that we should be an independent people, when there are many problems that we should face. If this message is implayed, people can be tired and will get depression because they cannot get what they want.

Thus, this approaches wide-ranging and inspiring.

On the other hand, high- toned attires are not suitable for them. Since educational institutions are for studying despite to show their status. Moreover discipline is a major practice of life which every individual should attain. For example, Uniform would be a more effective strategy for improving discipline especially in schools and organisations. Therefore this is a contributing factor.

To recapitulate, although several children do not like to wear uniform because they feel uncomfortable, I strongly agree, by doing this it will help them reintegrate back into society and give them some means of support. ",No,Yes,6.5
"In most cultures, people are taught to respect the elderly. Is it important to respect the elderly? How does one demonstrate respect to the elderly?Be specific and give concrete response","It is a pretty well known fact, that in the majority of countries people show respect to the elderly ones. This gesture shows good behavior and discipline. In my opinion it is very important to demonstrate respect to the elderly people for many reasons, which many of them will be examined below.

To start with, in my country Greece the demonstration of respect to the old people is something that someone can be find in every family and in every person’s principals, with very little exceptions. We believe that this is very important for them because as time goes by they get older and they feel more lonely and disappointed, so what we have to do is to show them our love and appreciation. Moreover, it is a usual phenomenon that when the parents are in work they call their kids’ grandparents to keep an eye on them until they come back. I believe that this is a very serious reason to respect our grandparents and generally the elderly people

There are many ways to show our respect to an old person. In case he is a relative of us, we can show our respect and love by giving him a kiss or call him for a dinner. Furthermore, a good option is to buy him a gift that he was always wanted. Also if we see someone old enough who cannot pass the driveway, it will be great for him to help him pass easy and safe. Last but not least we should avoid talking to them baldly and not paying attention to them because they feel sad something that is very bad for an old person.

To end up I deeply believe that we must show respect and have time with the elderly people because they deserve it and that will make happy not only us but the old person too. ",No,Yes,6.5
People all over the world listen to music. Why is music important to so many cultures? Give specific details and reasons to support your viewpoint.,"It is a widely known fact that music is something that exists in every country and all over the world. It plays a significant part in peoples’ lives as it enhances them with a full of beneficial things, which many of them will be examined below.

First of all, music contributes to the emotions of people. Many times we see, at clubs, parties or live events, thousands of people to entertain their selves and have fun only by hearing the type of music that they like. Also there is a usual thing to put a specific type of music according to the emotions we feel that moment. For example when I am feeling sad I listen to emotional songs or if I am happy I want to listen exciting music dance or even sing. Additionally some research has shown that music helps in concentration, reduction of stress and even boosts a person’s durability.

Furthermore music from the beginning of its existence has been connecting people. Traditional dance was a type of expression. From it every culture could express its emotions and describe its heroically events, transferring the area’s history to the other generations. Moreover traditional dances played an important role, as they were different in each country and from them people could express the folkway of each area.

To end up I deeply believe that music is something really important to someone’s psychology and something that it has played a big role on the evolution of mankind. ",No,Yes,6.5
Some people say that it's possible to tell a lot about a person's culture and character from the choice of clothes. Do you agree or disagree?,"It is commonly argued that a person’s clothing highly represents their personality and also the society where they reside. I firmly advocate this point of view as I believe that the colour of people’s clothes is rooted in the nations’ culture, and in personal terms, the cleanliness of one’s garments shows how disciplined that person is.

Regarding the social aspects of attire, it is widely debated that they can indicate numerous facts about a nation’s culture. To be more specific, the outstanding colours observed in the clothes in society may represent the rate of happiness. For example, Being delighted, individuals tend to wear the clothes with bright colours, but on the other side, they put on the ones in black when unhappy or depressed. While there is no doubt that people sometimes wear black clothes in winter just to attract less cold, it is almost clear that dark colours are indicators of depression.

Moreover, clothing could be also discussed in personal terms because the cleanliness of one’s garment represents how disciplined he/she is in life. The reason is that the people who are highly obsessed with tidiness and cleanliness at home or workplace may have the same obsession in their appearance as well. For instance, an employee in wrinkled trousers and bad-smelled shirts is perceived to have an untidy and smelly home as well. While many individuals believe in a famous expression that “don’t buy a book from its cover”, the role of personal discipline in wearing neat clothes has been accepted by many psychologists.

In conclusion, I agree with this statement that people’s clothing is deeply rooted in their culture and personality because many items such as colour can tell about a nation’s overall happiness rate, and the tidiness of one’s clothes could represent his/her discipline in life. ",No,Yes,6.5
"In most cultures, people are taught to respect the elderly. Is it important to respect the elderly? How does one demonstrate respect to the elderly? Be specific and give concrete examples in your response.","In a big number of countries, the majority of people are taught to show respect to the older generations. This is something really significant and can be shown in a lot of ways some of which are going to be mentioned below.

To begin with, respecting the elderly is of a high importance because they are the ones that raised and educated us. This means that they already have sacrificed a lot in order for us to become successful adults and one of the minimal things that we could do is appreciate them. Beside this we need to maintain this kind of behaviour around them because they always were beside us during difficult times so we could feel at ease again and get a hold of ourselves. No matter how you see it they have done a great deal of things for us so respecting them is a must.

Obviously, there are a lot of ways to show your respect one of which is to help them do things they are not able to do any more like lifting heavy objects. We could also provide them with food and medicine when necessary just like they did for us when we were young to show them that we appreciate what they have done throughout all these years. And last but not least, is to make sure when we don’t see them to call them so they can; t feel loved and that there are people that care for them.

In conclusion, respecting elderly should be a characteristic of every young person; s personality for a lot of reasons and there are also plenty ways to accomplish this. Fortunately this kind of behaviour is being adopted by more and more individuals leading to a reassuring future. ",No,Yes,6.5
"It is generally believed that some people are born with certain talents, for instance for sport or music, and others are not. However, it is sometimes claimed that any child can be taught to become a good sports person or musician. Discuss both these views and e your own opinion","When it comes to skills like music and sports, it is a common concept that only the people born with the certain talents can accel in that field. While many believe that skill and talent is not an inborn trait but can be instilled into a person to make him good in the respective field.

It is certainly true that some people are born talented and with minimal training and support they can become very successful. Undoubtedly, some are born musicians and have these skills passed onto them from their ancestors. In the similar fashion, sportsmanship also tends to run in the families. In the sub-continent, the Fateh family is quite famous when it comes to music. They have produced great musicians over the years, their fore-fathers were among the best musicians of their times. This talent has been passed onto the younger generations, who are now one of the most successful and famous musicians of the music industry.

On the other hand, it is widely believed that skills like music and athletic talents can be developed in a person with practice and hard-work and is not merely a matter of inborn traits. We have seen many athletes who had come from an anonymous background with minimum opportunities available, but their passion and craze for the particular sports made them to work endlessly until they achieved expertise in that field. A famous Pakistani bowler, Muhammad Aamir belonged to a anonymous town of Paskistan and used to play cricket in the streets of his town but his passion drived him to learn the skill to became one of the best bowlers of the World.

In conclusion, it is true that talents do run in the families and some people are born skilled. However, it is not a given that only naturally talented individuals can prosper in the fields like music and sports, but these expertise can be achieved over time with practice and training.

Cultures around the world becoming more and more similar,"It is said that in today's globalized world cultures and traditions are indistinguishable to compare to last decades. This essay will discuss the main causes why people face to similarity are of influence wastern culture and give some possible development to this. To my mind, this have more negative outweigh positive.

First of all, in this day and age advertisement are ubiquitous and play pivotal role in promoting latest trend and fashion followed by some developed countries. Many developing cultures people trying to adapt to the modern culture whether what it is about food, clothes and music. Furthemore, in social media sites especially young generations have common interests about music and they may immatiate to their fans with a lot of ways such as they reply to dance on behind tiktok dancers, girls who like to follow follow models are tend to make up their face, change their styles to look like like a kind of puppet or some open clothes attract more and more young people that it is seen as an image of modernity Personally i believe that this does not conform to the custom of some eastern peoples or some individuals argue that distorts the behaviour of the people

Secondly, It is true that when people travel to abroad, it is comforting to use leisure amenities, people can eat in their favourite food no matter where this produced and listen some kind of music such as English music popular with everyone. Besides, this helps also economy of nation as international industry development and attracts more tourists.

Business culture in globalization impact on an international business with operations in different countries.,"Over the last three decades, a fundamental shift has been occurring in the world economy. We are moving toward a world in which barriers to cross-border trade and investment are declining; perceived distance is shrinking due to advances in transportation and telecommunications technology; material culture is starting to look similar the world over, and national economies are merging into an interdependent, integrated global economic system. The process by which this is occurring is commonly referred to as globalization.

Globalization has resulted in greater cross-national business and cultural interactions. This also means the business culture has considerable importance for an international business with operations in different countries. When you’re dealing with people from another culture, you may find that their business practices, communication, and management styles are different from those to which you are accustomed. Understanding the culture of the people with whom you are dealing is important to successful business interactions and to accomplishing business objectives.

Occasionally business culture will affect your ability to enter an international market, develop and maintain business relationships, negotiate successful deals, conduct sales, conduct marketing, advertising campaigns, engage in manufacturing, and distribution.

In conclusion, we need to understand the point of view of people who worry about cultural globalization because it is a threat to national traditions. However, this is outweighed by its positive impact on international understanding and the fact that it represents progress within a society. ",No,Yes,6.5
Personality of people is reflected by fashion. Do you think it's positive or negative.,"Individual's personality, these days, reflects owing to fashion. Consciousness towards fashionable goods is extremely common among communities. This essay will shed light on reasons behind this, however, I consider it to be a positive trend rather than its negative ones.

The underlying reasons associated with why people's preference is more towards trendy clothes are following. The most dominating reason is that physical appearance becomes a necessary part of individual's life. To explain it, people, in 21st century, have more care about their outside looks rather than inside, therefore, a big chunk of money is consumed by them on fashionable clothing. In addition to this, people consider personality as an imperative part of their life. The standout example of this is that women in new generation have more focus on fashionable products since they consider it to be a success in life. Thereby, from these above mentioned reasons it is proven that fashion should be there in life of folks.

Moreover, for organizations, manufacturing trendy clothes or goods becomes a huge business. To make it more clear, numerous craftman make an effort to design clothes which can also renowned at international level. This development would provide favorable benefits to everyone.

In conclusion, fashion industry is not only achieving huge goals but also offer opportunities for denizens. I perceive that fashion holds Number of benefits for countries progress. ",No,Yes,6.5
music bring people of different cultures together agree or disagree,"It is often said that music has the power to unite and connect people, regardless of their cultural backgrounds or ages. I completely agree with this view, and will give my reasons below.

Music can certainly reach across cultural and national boundaries and bring people together. Perhaps the best example of this would be the Live Aid concerts that took place back in the 1980s, and which were broadcast to a global audience. Two live events were held simultaneously in the UK and the US, and the objective was to raise funds for famine relief in Ethiopia. The concerts were a huge success, both in terms of the number of people around the world who watched them and their impact on international public awareness of the famine. They demonstrated, I believe, that music truly is the planet’s global language.

Just as it transcends cultures, music also has the ability to connect people from different generations. Regardless of age, we can all enjoy a memorable melody, a strong rhythm or a beautiful singing voice, and the best songs seem to have the same magical effect on all of us. This would explain why televised music competitions, such as ‘The X Factor’ or ‘The Voice’, are such popular prime-time shows. These programmes attract incredibly broad audiences because singing and popular songs appeal to children, parents and grandparents alike. I would argue that no other form of entertainment can bring families together in this way.

In conclusion, I believe that music is unique in its capacity to create shared experiences between people, irrespective of culture and age. ",No,Yes,6.5
Some people believe that the Internet brings people of different ages and cultures together. To what extent do you agree with this opinion?,"It is widely believed that as electronic devices became more advanced, people began to communicate more over the internet, bringing them closer together. On the contrary, there is a certain group of people who believe that the Internet has pushed people far apart. Before coming to a logical conclusion, we'll look at both sides and I will explain further in this essay.

To begin with, we must acknowledge how technological advancements have altered the whole world and brought individuals from all over the planet together with a single touch. In the past, sending a message to another location would take a long time, or you could have to go to their location to give the message, which was inefficient and time-consuming. Now, we just engage with each other, and the message is sent to their side in a second. Consequently, People, particularly adolescents, begin enjoy conversing through numerous online sites as technology progresses at a breakneck rate, because it helps them to keep in touch with their distant relatives and friends. For example, Facebook, a widely used social networking site, has millions of members who connect with one another on a regular basis, sharing their thoughts on a variety of issues and forming communities with others who have shared interests.

On the other hand, while the Internet connects people digitally, it isolates them socially in the meantime, because the more time they spend online, the less time they spend engaging in real life. People who are hooked to the internet and can't get away from their devices will not develop any social skills or gain any knowledge that’s essential for their lives. This is a major disadvantage since it will put them in perplexing situations that they won't know how to handle. Many people assume that technological communication is less comprehensive and trustworthy than communication done by face-to-face conversation or over the phone. Social connections are built on the facades of other internet users, whose anonymous activities might be deceptive and unpredictable.

To sum up, despite all of this, I continue to notice flaws in the evolution of interface technologies since there is an enormous amount of time each person spends on the Internet and separates from each other. But we can’t forget to mention the contributions that technology has made to human contact, and I believe that the mentioned flaw is easily remedied. ",No,Yes,6.5

Because of the different setting, the first interac between the writer and the bird is also not the same. With an excited emotion when she saw the hawk for the first time, Helen lightly slowly softly covered the hawk’s eyes with the hood with a series of actions which was described as: ”I grabbed the hood from the box and turned to the hawk. Her beak was open, her hackles raised; her wild eyes were the colour of sun on white paper, and they stared because the whole world had fallen into them at once. One, two, three. I tucked the hood over her head. ” while the writer of “An unexpected meeting” with the altruism try to save the penguin at all cost even in a violent way like: “. . .

I pinned it down and, with my hand inside the bag (it was no time to be eating apples), grabbed its feet. ”.

In this time of advanced technology it is hard to say that this world is old-fashioned. But is caring for our environment is old-fashioned? It seems that every country in the world has with pollution. I think that these problems can be fixed. But where do we start?,"In this time of advanced technology it is hard to say that this world is old-fashioned. But is caring for our environment is old-fashioned? It seems that every country in the world has with pollution. I think that these problems can be fixed. But where do we start?

We begin with transport. Emissions from cars greatly damage the environment and the fact that almost every citizen has one doesn’t make it any better. A good solution to that would be to motivate people to use electric cars. The second place to check would be rivers and seas. Anything from sunken transport to waste thrown out by people should be cleaned since it creates trouble both for animals and us. The third problem would be littering. Why? Because a lot of packaging used and thrown away is not biodegradable. Keeping the package on your person and throwing it away at the bin should do the trick.

In conclusion, I have shown you that we have a lot of problems with taking care of environment, but we have the solutions to them. All we need is just enough time and effort.

Part 2. 3

Throughout our lives we learn many things and obtain many characteristics. Some are good, some are bad. It’s really hard to say which one is the most useful. But I would say that the most useful thing I have ever learned is the ability to look at life a little more easier and find balance in things you do on every day basis.

You can’t expect great work if you don’t have a great rest. These things are pretty proportional, in my opinion. Not only that, living in constant stress and work won’t do you a lot of good, so a rest that can take care of all that before the next time you sit to do something tedious should be helpful. But don’t let that rest take all of your time or else you’ll fall behind. Plan your time ahead, balance your rest and work so that you won’t be consumed by them. Doesn’t that sound great?

In the end, not everyone will agree with me, but that’s ok. That’s my opinion and I agree with myself. I just wanted to share that thought with anyone reading this. ",No,Yes,6.5
A gossip culture pervades most companies. Employees like to talk about their bosses or other employees. Is there any advantage to this? What do you think are the disadvantages?,"Gossip is a dominant culture in the corporate world. In many circles, gossip is considered as a tool to gather information and build intimacy among colleagues, while others seem it as harmful phenomenon that that destroys trust and assails credibility. In the instance, I am of the honest opinion that gossip is the one of the major adversaries of a healthy corporate culture. In following essay i will discuss both merits and dimerits of gossip culture.

To commence with, there is several reasons which can support th benefits of gossip culture. Gossip, in fact, is nothing but implies office politics. It will be difficult for bosses of big companies to find out about the rumors in the company without gossiping. As a result, the company goes bankrupt. Secondly, not only does gossip harms the intended person, but also everyone in the organization with the help of gossip, the campaign grows faster and its revenue increases dramatically. Thus, gossip spreads quickly among people

On the other hand, big company executives suffer from gossip. To give an illustration of what I mean, to head of company or the employees in company may become unemployed. Also, through gossip company employees commit crimes because this is a case against the law. For instance, coca-cola workers were caught trying to sell company secrets.

To recapitulate, gossip strengthens trust and intimacy but on the contrary creates disagreements between people",No,Yes,6.5
Do you agree with the writer's views on the value of modern inventions? Why or why not?,"Modern inventions have made life more comfortable than what it was before. More and more new things are being made in all countries throughout the world to make life even more comfortable.

In the past men had great difficulty in ploughing their lands to grow food. But, today, giant machines are used to plough thousands of acres of land. As a result, more food can be grown in a shorter time than was possible before. To carry the food motor-vehicles, steam-ships and various other means of transport have been invented. Shortage of food in one place no longer causes anxiety as it can be brought from another place within a very short time.

The invention of the means of transport has also made it possible for people to work in places miles away, and children can attend schools in distant places. In the past, this was not possible. The children of today are therefore better educated than those of the past. Invention of the means of transport has also increased human activity. A man can now go to several places, and do a variety of things in a day's time

Other inventions like the radio and the telephone have also contributed much to human progress. The radio keeps us informed about developments in other parts of the world. We do not have to travel to know what is happening in places away from our homes. The telephone too is a convenient means of knowing about others, miles away. It helps in business transactions by reducing time and travel. A businessman in one town can talk to another in another town, several miles away, to do some important business. In all these ways, people are able to do many things without much loss of time.

In the same way, every invention has helped to increase our comforts. Television, for example, now makes it possible for people to stay at home and enjoy. At the same time, however, modern inventions have caused many deaths and much sorrow to many people. Yet modern inventions have

Some people claim that immigrants should adopt the local culture when they arrive in a new country. Others think that they should maintain their culture instead. Discuss both views and give your opinion,"These days, more and more people are moving to new countries to begin a new life. Some argue that these newcomers should take on the local customs, while others believe they should preserve their heritage. I strongly believe that assimilation into the target culture is key for a nation to function as one in order to succeed.

A prosperous country utilizes the power of its people. As such, its citizenry must strive for common goals, which are to become strong, economically secure, and free from outside influence. This happens by creating a communal feeling among the residents. For example, Americans subscribe the melting pot, a concept that emphasizes being American first and Asian, African, or other identity second. Consequently, everyone can be an equal, proud member of the nation and collectively propel it forward. In contrast, focusing on maintaining one’s past traditions makes the goals of the nation becomes secondary.

Another reason to assimilate is to speed up one’s integration into the system by finding a job, making friends, establishing a social safety net, and so on. This begins with language and customs. If one communicates effectively, he can build up his new life successfully. To illustrate, consider the second generation of immigrants; these young people were raised on the local culture, speak the language fluently, and tend to advance further than their parents. This suggests that if the latter had adapted to their new home more quickly rather than holding on to their past, they might have been more successful. Indeed, they did not principally emigrate to another country to conserve or promote their cultures and traditions, but in pursuit of better living conditions.

In conclusion, while one’s heritage is important, it can be detrimental to one’s ability to integrate into a new culture and contribute to its success. Therefore, immigrants should quickly adapt to their new homes. ",No,Yes,6.5
"Nowadays, teamwork is in fashion in the workplace and many people prefer working with a group of people. What are the advantages and disadvantages teamwork brings to people who prefer to do so.","In modern times, the issue of teamwork has become highly controversial. The causes of this phenomenon are varied in the workplace. This essay will outline the reasons why work in a group occurring, and explore some potential solutions to this issue.

Generally speaking, there are a wide range of reasons why people prefer to work in a group. Firstly, teamwork is good for better understanding. When people work in a group, rather than work in alone, it helps them to know better their colleagues. For example, if someone get a job in higher company, they way of work in a group help may their colleagues know very well. Secondly, teamwork is a best place for sharing ideas and experience. This is because, when someone work in a group, they can express their personal ideas and experience, which they learn for their real life. It helps them to broaden their ideas. Furthermore, if people work in a team, they may be capable to critical thinking, which boosts solve problem easily.

On the other hand, there are several throwback works in a group. The primary reason of this idea is that teamwork is time consuming. For example, if people work in a team, sometimes they need too much time for problem solve, and sometimes they wait for other teammates due to his problem. The secondary reason of idea is that work in a group make place congested. This is because, many people work in one place exact time, which hamper main aims of team.

In conclusion, teamwork is a topic which is very relevant to modern society. It is the best way to work in a group, unlike work in alone. If management implements this policy in workplace, it will provide better understanding and work in together. ",No,Yes,6.5
"According to the writer, raising legal driving age are would not really increase road safety. Do you agree with the writer’s views? Why/ why not?","I agree with the writer that raising legal driving age are would not really increase road safety. While I agree that driving age rise can have effective in reducing road accidents, I believe that other factors are equally important. If a person crosses the road unexpectedly, for example, teenagers might be surprised and extremely scared, adults might make quicker and wiser decisions. Besides, I think that there are three better solutions to increase road safety. First of all, the government should encourage people to use public transports instead of private ones in order to reduce the level of accidents. In addition, traffic police should fine traffic violators heavily or take away driver's licenses if they break the law. As a result of stringent traﬃc regulations, drivers will obey the law and accidents decrease. Finally, the authorities should allocate ﬁnancial resources to improving public transport and invest more money in building infrastructures such as one-way roads or dividing lanes for different types of vehicles. That would create better conditions for drivers. In conclusion, although raising the driving age certainly affects the number of accidents, there are other measures that are better. ",No,Yes,6.5

However it will have the impact on children. The children must face ignorance. Women have the ability to groom the personality of the children she focused on the up bring of the children.

In the society women will get a lot of confidence while working away from home. It will make it very easy for her to survive in case of a single parent. The working women can face every problem very easily and counter those problems. For example in my country women rights are not equal in all the regions of the country for that they must work to get exposure.

Hence I believe that men and women working together make the family survival easy. It will lead towards good impact on society as the world is moving fast and the survival has become very uncertain so the main thing is that society always praises working men and women but it will be done in a way that their children are not affected.

"Some people suggest that when we learn a language, we should also learn the cultures and lifestyles of this country.","There’s an ongoing debate of whether or not we should learn the cultures and lifestyles of the country when we want to learn a new language. In my opinion, I fully agree with the viewpoint.

First and foremost, I do agree it is very important for us to learn the grammar and vocabulary if we want to advance a new language. However if we realize, we learned our mother language not by books. We observed how our family communicated, how our teacher told us stories, and then we tried to imitate them. We know when to use formal language, when to use sarcasm, when to talk casually through a life experience. This concept should be applied when we want to learn a new language.

As an Indonesian, I have learned english since kindergarten because it is a must have subject in my school. However, no matter how good my grammatical knowledge is, I still stutter when I talk in English whenever I travel to English speaking countries. I realized this often happens because I didn't understand the culture. For example, in Indonesia or any other asian country, it is highly impolite to talk casually with elderly especially to call them by their names. We usually call our aunt with “tante” before the name or “uncle” if he’s a male. But when I met my American uncle, he told me to just call him Bobby, which is his name. This may seem simple but it actually can dramatically change our relationship.

In conclusion, I highly agree we should also learn the cultures, manager, and lifestyles of the country when we want to advance a new language. ",No,No,5.5
"When students study a foreign language, they should also study the culture and lifestyle of the people who speak the language. Do you agree or disagree?","Of late, the trends of studying foreign languages like English, French and Chinese are exponentially increasing across the world. In such a situation, some people assert that the students should also study the cultural and lifestyle aspects of the ‘natives’ speaking the particular language they are learning. Nevertheless, I personally disagree with it.

The culture and lifestyle of foreign countries need not be studied by the students due to a variety of reasons. First and foremost, it is critical to recognise that the students’ own cultural traditions and lifestyles are of high significance could be of higher significance. If they study foreign cultures and lifestyles, their native culture will be distorted. For instance, a recent survey by National Geographic magazine exhibited that the local cultural values of have been forgotten by some students who started studying American culture while pursuing education in Mumbai University. Secondly, such study of foreign cultures and lifestyles should not be imposed on anyone. Students, particularly in today’s democratic world, should have their own choice in this regard.

Admittedly, it is also true that while learning a foreign language in a proper way, building an understanding of their ‘native’ cultural values and lifestyle could be a game changer. For this, the students could be required to watch movies of particular cultures. Secondly, this is important to develop a cosmopolitan culture also, which will eventually lead to convergence of diverse cultures across the world. However, in this context, it should not be forgotten that studying foreign culture should be an option, not a compulsion.

On the basis of the above deliberations, it could precisely be concluded that the arguments against compulsion to study foreign culture which learning some language are more convincing and stronger (more substantial) vis-à-vis arguments in its favour. This is, inter-alia, due to the necessity of protection of native culture from distortions. ",No,Yes,6.5
"Inspite the advancement in agriculture, the world still faces hunger","There are a lot of advancements in the field of agriculture in recent years, but still the world faces the problem of hunger. The main reasons for this scenario is the reduction in farm land and farmers and also insufficient preservation and transportation facilities. Howerver there are various solutions to this problem

Agriculture is improving nowadays due to increased technological advancements. But this is not sufficient to meet the needa of the world. Firstly, the number of farmers and land available for agriculture is plummeting. Current generation is inclined towards white collar jobs such as office works. Moreover, agricultural land is converted into areas for constructing houses and buildings. Secondly, due to poor transportation and preservation technologies the agricultural commodities which are produced in one location is not accessible to other areas. For instance, several news reports have shown the wastage of tomato during harvesting season in the northern part of India due to lack of refrigeration system. All these can cause insufficient food supply around the world.

These problems can be eradicated by various methods. Government should form several schemes to encourage upcoming generation to take up agriculture and also should provide support to farmers like subsidies to promot agriculture. Furthermore, agricultural produce must be preserved and transported to those in need by taking the advantage of technology.

To conclude, many around us are still with empty stomachs even if the technological advancements in agriculture is rising. People should be encouraged to make agriculture their profession and also the food should be made available to those in desperate need. ",No,No,6.5
"Reflection about business culture, journalistic translation, culture, and literary translation","During the series of talkshow, I went through four themes including “Business culture in the contemporary business world” by Ph. D Phan Cong Chinh, “Journalistic translation” by M. A Nguyen Thanh Nam, “American pop culture” by Ph. D Hoang Thach Quan, and “Literary translation” by M. A Le Huy Loc.

First and foremost, I would like to give a special thanks for the very informative sharing and meaningful conversation from the four guests, and I would like to give a special thanks for holding these useful talkshow by the teachers from the Faculty of English Linguistics and Literature as well.

As expected, I have a general view of four themes regarding business, journalism, culture, and literature. I will share some of my observations and experience about the talkshow as follows.

Firstly, my observation from the first speaker’s sharing demonstrates that business culture plays a vital role in small and large companies alike. Its aim is to make a connection among employees and enhance the quality and effectiveness of the company as a whole as well as promote its empowerment. In particular, each company creates their own business culture as core values which have a huge impact on every employee. As a fresher, we are distinct individuals with different personalities and perspectives, therefore, it’s essential to learn and be instructed in the core values of the company. As a result, we should know what to do to implement and express the core values effectively. Thus, the training department is supposed to be very important in training people about the mutual business culture regardless of being in any position. Business culture such as core values, mission statement, philosophy, or creed must be prioritized to form at the beginning. As my experience in a To me, as a will-be graduate, I must have awareness of my almost lack of experience and capacity. Then, I always show my can-do attitude and curiosity and don’t hesitate to ask for help if any difficulties with the hope to best-accomplish the work and contribute to the company’s development.

Secondly, in terms of journalistic translation, it’s not merely translation from the source language to the target language, rather journalistic translators are supposed to collect, edit, and rewrite articles based on many resources in different newspapers in order to publish every type of news in accordance with journalistic style. The aim is to provide the production of news which is reasonable for the specific local audience and the journalistic norms in the region. The importance of copyright of the news in journalism is taken into consideration. The big newspaper offices in Vietnam, for example, almost buy the copyright of subscriptions or the exploitation of the resources, images of the overseas newspaper. Being students in translation and interpreting, we can apply for the collaborator position in some newspaper offices. However, we are not journalists, but translators, thus, we just provide the translation version. To be more professional in journalism, we must possess four requirements including faithfulness, accuracy, effectiveness, and clearness. When translating, editing, writing news, we should take some notice: the six questions principle of writing brief news (who, what, when, where, why, how), the different title between English news and Vietnamese news, and the regular research and update on new terms.

Thirdly, regarding American pop culture, I was introduced to the two distinct definitions of “Culture” and “cultures”.

The cultural framework between Vietnam and America is different, therefore, if we want to understand and not to misunderstand the event, we should put it in the proper context and put on the cultural lens of that particular country.

Children are getting 10% weight from past year.Give your causes and effects?,"It is often argued that in western society, the rate of overweight child has been increased around 20% in terms of 10 years. There are many causes and effects which would be discuss in following fragment.

The main causes and effects for overweight children is due to their food habitat and lack of physical exercise. Many children at present days like to eat junk food outside which is bad to our health. Due to this type of food intake their weight get increased rapidly in small age. Another problem is Physical exercise. children have latest technology like videogames, computer, Television which makes them lazy and make habits of involving into it hours to hours. Due to this activity many children are getting lazy and effecting their health and habitat.

To overcome with this problem, there are many solution to it. But some solution are Physical exercise and participating with friends. For induce, Instead of playing videogames inside the house. If children play outside with their friends then it help them to improve their habitat. Where as another factor for improving their health is sports, if children play sports which they find more interesting it will help them to be active and fit. Healthy food play vital role to children. Parents should prevent to children's not to eat junk food which is easily available in market place. They should provide nutrient food which makes them healthy.

Overall we can conclude that due to junk food and lack of physical activities our today generation is being lazy and inactive due to which it is effecting to their health and life. To overcome this effects, healthy food and sports helps them to be active and wealthy. If this activity is done to children then we can today generation children more beneficial in future.

It is generally accepted that families are not as close as they used to be. Give some reasons why this change has happened and suggest how families could be brought closer together.,"Nowadays, people’s lifestyle has changed in comparison to the past and family members are not as close as they used to be for several reasons such as the economic issues and the growth of technology. Despite the fact that some would argue that this problem will correct itself overtime, in my view, there is much that can be done to address this problem constructively.

The first reason that families are far from each other these days can be the staggering costs of life which enforce almost all family members to work hard even overtime to provide money and amenities for the family. The rising inflation rate affects all parts of people’s lives and living expenses such as accommodation, either purchasing or renting, eating products, clothes, and other necessities. People, therefore, have to overwork and they cannot find free time spending with their family members in relief. Besides, by the growth of technology, most people tend to spend their time talking to their friends on social media or surfing the internet. So, this keeps people amused and away from their families.

One possible approach would be the government efforts and negotiations in order to hinder the day by day increase in prices; especially the price of dollar which has the significant and direct impact on people’s lives. This would certainly tackle the problem. However, measures like this would be considered as excessive and difficult to be done quickly. A more feasible approach would be time-management in using technology by family members. For instance, family members are to spend their time together after work rather than spending their time on social media or playing games on their gadgets.

In conclusion, it is true that this problem will probably not be solved quickly. However, that is not the reason to avoid taking actions. If the government and people take appropriate actions in this case, this problem will definitely be solved overtime and families could be brought closer together again, I suppose. ",No,Yes,6.5
ensuring that children have regular physical exercise should be the responsibility of parents and therefore schools should not waste valuable school time having sports lessons as part of the curriculum. To what extent do you agree?,"How can we assure that students actively participate in physical exercises? Some people hold a view that sport lessons in schools should be eliminated while parents can be responsible for arranging related activities. I completely disagree with this opinion for the following reasons.

Firstly, attending physical curriculum provides an opportunity for teachers to unveil children’s talents in sports. Many students who perform poorly on traditional core subjects might have enormous potential in achieving athletic success. For instance, as a remarkable basketball player, Michael Jordan was discovered by his school coach and consequently obtained tremendous achievements in sports industry. Nevertheless, if Michael Jordan did not attend sports classes and was not encouraged by his PE teacher, he would have struggled on passing traditional subjects for graduation and would not be accepted by well-known university for his natural endowment in sports.

Besides, taking sports lessons allows children to relax from tense academic studies. As many students are compulsively required to attain acceptable on core subjects to graduate and to be enrolled in famous universities, children usually spend tremendous time studying traditional courses and feel stressed. Whereas if sports lessons are properly arranged for children, they will have time to play with their peers and will ease down from onerous academic study. Moreover, since parents already lay much focus on heavy workloads, there is less time to ensure children’s zealous participation in physical exercises.

In conclusion, as students’ athletic potential can be explored by teachers from sports schools and children are provided arranged time to decompress from heavy academic studies. Therefore, cutting down sports courses should be reconsidered. ",No,Yes,6.5
"For the last few years, children's children’s development has been a very concerned problem.","For the last few years, children's children’s development has been a very concerned problem. While parents are supposed to be responsible for their kid's daily exercises so school time should not be wasted on sports lessons, I disagree with the above opinion. I believe that schools play the mót most significant role in instructing children to do physical exercises.

At the outset, obviously, mother and father are people who love their children than anyone else. Therefore, they want to do everything for their kids including teaching them how to do physical exercises. However, they can not be always the best teachers in that field. To develope comprehensively, children should study from well-qualified teachers. Although, today, parents are able to learn about physical activities on YouTube, Facebook or take part in courses, sometimes, they may teach the their kids the wrong actions, which leads to the abnormal development of children.

If schools spend time on sport lessons, children can improve their particular skills and necessary knowledge. According to the WSJ, a very famous newspaper of USA, most children who are taught sports by teachers at schools can develop better than children who are only taught by their parents. Moreover, sports help to improve children's abilities to focus on their studies, remember lessons longer and practice better in life. Therefore, it is a not wasted of time to let children study the physical exercise in schools. Kids need to develop both their minds and their bodies at the same time.

To sum up, the physical education in schools should need to be taught in schools. Children always need to learn the best directions and to have the best conditions and environments to grow up healthy. ",Yes,Yes,6.5
Essay topic: Some people think that school children need to learn practical skills such as car maintenance and bank account management along with the academic subject school. To what extend do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays the students are learning many things within a school lesson. They are learning mostly about some theoretical skills such as history, math and chemistry. But some people think that the students should be taught more about practical skills that will help them to survive when they grow up such us car maintenance and bank account management. In my opinion both views are equally important.

To begin with, more practical skills will help youngsters to face many problems. To be more specific, those skills are something very useful as they will help them to live more easily and face every daily difficulty that might show up during their life. For example, if the students learn how to manage their bank account they will make purchases and they will never face a financial problem. Also another significant practical skill is the car maintenance. For example they will be helped a lot as they will have the knowledge on how to react if they stuck in the middle of nowhere.

But, except from the practical skills the students should teach theoretical subjects to broaden their horizons. Subjects such as chemistry and biology are extremely important for a doctor as he cannot diagnose a disease without that. Additionally, philosophy and history are important for a teacher so that he can teach his knowledge to the next generations. What I mean is that the theoretical skills that the youngsters learn in school is significant because those subjects are that will help them understand the practical skills and then they can combine all the knowledge they have and live a nice life.

To sum up some people believe that the students have to learn except from the academics subjects some practical skills. Personally I think that practical skills should be taught in school as long as the teachers do not limit the theoretical

Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taugh to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.,"Encouraging a sense of competition in children have its own advantages and disadvantages. The first time they develop this is when they engage in games, and their reactions upon receiving a win or a loss should be closely monitored by the parents. For example, being the winner may be a positive reinforcement to boost their drive to accomplish something again, or it may also make them complacent and too proud. On the other hand, losing in a particular child’s play may harness feelings of inadequacy and injure their self-worth, or it may be a definite reason to try harder and get better next time. The surrounding adults, especially the parents, have a pivotal role in guiding children on enriching their competitive side as well as the dangers of mediocrity, overachievement, and attaching their self-esteem to contests.

What about children who are trained to cooperate than compete? As others would believe, have greater potential to contribute as adults in the future. This is because every industry requires the principal skill of collaborating with people of different specializations to achieve their overall vision. A healthy competition is welcome as long as there is mutual respect and understanding; otherwise, it may be detrimental to the individual, the companies, and organizations. Competition based on the intent of beating the opponent tend to harbor negative emotions and may cost more than the reward; but competition on the grounds of refining one’s abilities to become the best in a particular craft have higher chances of receiving opportunities in the future.

I reckon that collaboration is the most important skill that should be augmented during childhood, because this stage of life is where most of our personality traits and habits are formed. The most successful leaders are followed, respected, and revered because of their ability to work with and not against people. It they are able to work together at an early age to attain a common goal, the chances of creating a positive ripple effect are higher for future generations. ",No,Yes,6.5
Some people think it is better to choose friends who always have the same opinions as them. Other people believe it is good to have friends who sometimes disagree with them.,"Some would argue that choosing friends with same ideas is so useful, while others say that having friends with different opinions has more advantages. While choosing someone as a friend with different think might be a good idea, but I believe that it is better to select a friend with the same thought.

On the one hand, choosing a friend with different think has huge negative impacts on people life. Two people with different ideas and opinions have to discuss in many aspects and tend to persuade each other, and they also have difficulties to make a final decision regarding the debate topic. These kinds of relationship cause to decline the respect and get them to irritate for any issues even not the important one. For example, during my childhood, I had a friend with a completely different idea and we never could arrange and make a decision on the same topic. I believe that this kind of friendship no has any positive effect on people life.

On the other hand, when people get familiar with someone who has the same beliefs and idea with them, they could experience so many astonishing issues in their life. People with common think and opinion can understand each other completely and respect the other's idea and decision and do some favour for each other. They also get on well and have lots of fun without any debate and discussion and have long term friendship. For Instance, in my own country, the majority of people that have friends with same opinion encounter and experience amazing times with them. I presume that this type of friendship is so preferable and included so beneficial for people’s life.

In conclusion, having friends with different ideas has a negative impact and I assume that it is better for people to choose a friend with the same opinion to enjoy their time. ",No,Yes,6

"Nowadays, parents are allowing their children to use tablets and smartphones to enhance learning. Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?","With the technological advancement in recent years and significant upgradation in education system, it cannot be denied that the children at very young age gets familiar to smartphones and tablets for their learning and school homework. Though, there are many benefits of advanced learning system for children, it do have certain limitations too that may affect them in one way or other.

When we talk about its usefulness in present era, children often catch-up the lessons fast due to the use of Artificial Intelligence while teaching complex topics, specifically in the subject of mathematics. In addition to this, it is convenient for them to study wherever they like, even in a society garden as tablet-like technologies are easy to carry anywhere without much hustle. They can further record the live lectures or pause the same to have a small break. These are the vital factors why children have accepted the technological improvements in existing education system. Many EduTech companies are providing the top-notch learning experience and flexibility which in turn help the students to accumulate higher grades.

On the other side, it has some surprises for parents as these devices allows the child to download games and other unnecessary stuffs that reverts their attention from learning. When the education delivered is effective then conventional classroom, the games and multimedia platforms available in the device are of superior quality too. Even adults get distracted from their busy schedule, children can be naturally here. Consequently, children have nearly dropped-out the outdoor activities from their curriculum which is replaced by online entertainment.

To sum up, we cannot ignore that technology is fruitful to current generation that has ability to transform your child's future, however, parents need to reconsider their parenting when it comes to handing over the mobile and smartphones on their child's hand. ",Yes,Yes,6.5
"It is commonly believed that nowadays main factors that affect a child's development are media, pop culture and friends. A different point of view is that family plays the most significant role. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","A person's personality is formed under the influence of family upbringing and external factors. Some people argue that external factors such as peer, media and teacher pressures have more effect on children temper than family. This essay will discuss both these points of view and argue in favour of the latter.

One the one hand, The books children read and the music they listen, form their beliefs and faiths. In other words, children tend to follow and imitate the behaviour of their favourite personality. Moreover, when a children are in school or play in playground, they are influenced by their peers. Finally, other factors, like the media, prompt children to want things regarded as fashionable. For instance, children demand toys that they see on television. Therefore, some people argue that external factors have an undeniable influence on the life of children and are predominant in shaping their future.

On the other hand, a child's personality is malleable at a very young age, and parents are often present in their life at this stage. Also, very young children love to imitate their parent's behavior. For example, children who have a dysfunctional family often exhibit behavioural problems at school. That is while, An emotionally safe home environment is critical for the child's confidence. Moreover, parents also teach children about setting boundaries. It is their behavior and upbringing that teaches children what friends to choose, what books to read, and what movies to watch.

Therefore, In my opinion, children's choice of friends, books or music and etc. depends on the values inspired in them by their parents. Therefore, parents hold more substantial mastery over their offspring than media, pop culture and friend groups.

In conclusion, it is undeniable that the outside world affects the intellectual and social development of children. However, I believe that it is the parents who, from a very young age, provide the ground for the positive or negative direction of these developments. ",No,Yes,6.5
It is more important to have a good family than to have friends. Family can always compensate for absence of friendship. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Numerous people would rather have one loyal comrade than have lots of acquaintances around the world. I agree also with this preference and think that a true friend is more worth.

First of all, I believe that the intimate mates give their friends a lot of motivation to overcome fierce time. In fact, not only do they participate to the matey happy moments, but also do not omit them alone among fluctuations of their life. That is while, acquaintances are only traders who exchange their joyances, knowledge and experiences are. Although, these communications are essential for personal growth, are not reliable completely. To cite an instance, all of teammates in workplace are not necessarily close friends and can be passive competitors. Therefore, extensive relationships with colleagues, classmates, online friends, etc. would not eliminate the requirement to be with a cordial comrade.

Secondly, all people need consideration and if they are not taken care of, they will be devastated. Yea, human beings will have neither mental health nor physical health without the attention of those around them. To illustrate if people do not have self-confidence, they will not improve their abilities, values and talents. At the same time, entire self-esteem of human is tied up with care and regard of others. This instinctive requirement is responded frequently by immediate family and cordial friends. So shallow and sometimes destructive relationship with acquaintances do not provide people's demands and wants.

"Some people think that the main purpose of schools is to turn children into good citizens and workers, rather to benefit them as individuals. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","People have different views about/ as to the primary goal of schools. While I agree that schools can transform children into useful members of society, I believe that they also bring benefits to students themselves.

On the one hand, turning children into useful citizens is the main purpose of schools. The primary reason is that the same core subjects such as math, literature and civic education are present in the curriculum of most schools. Children, therefore, are expected to share the same moral standards, general knowledge and skills. If all members of population were to have such criteria, society would become more stable and civilized as the crime rate would be low. If schools were to fail to equip their students with needed skills or standards, they would not become productive members of society. Thus, it is understandable why schools’ main responsibility is to producing good members of society.

On the other hand, it can argued that children themselves can reap of number of benefits. When children are taught a wide range of subjects, they can have the opportunity to become more well-rounded and widen their outlook on life. This would help them to be able to adapt to a new environment in their later life. Another benefit would be that schools are a perfect environment for students to develop their communication skill. This is largely because they are enabled to make friends with their classmates and talk to them virtually on a daily basis. This skill is considered / arguably highly beneficial for social life of children.

In conclusion, it is my view that schools not only produce good citizens for society but also bring benefits for each individual student. ",No,Yes,6.5
Some people believe that the experiences children have before they go to school will have the greatest effect on their future life. Others argue that experiences gained when they are teenagers have a bigger influence.,"Majority people consider that skills gained in the preschool period by children will have considerable consequence in future. However, some people think that knowledge obtained as a teenager has a greater impact than in childhood. Both sides have rights to exist and considered as equally fair, but I believe that experience gained at a teenage age has a significant impact than in the childhood period.

In preschool-age children are being carried by family members, which means they can not take actions without parental control. When a child does something wrong, the parent will guide how to do it the right way. That means a person is not able to learn from mistakes made in childhood and could forget all faults because parents taught to do everything from the beginning. Furthermore, when a person as a teenager will face problems, it is extremely likely that parents will be asked to help. However, parents might not be able to help every time and the issues should be solved without any assist.

At the teenage age, children are likely to get experience by making mistakes and learn from them. For example, when they get a low score on exams or being bullied teenagers are not likely to share with the problems they faced. As a consequence, children are likely to leave everything as it is or in some cases become stronger and pass the challenges they faced with. As soon as issues are solved without any assistance at teenage age, in the future other problems should not be as difficult as before.

To sum up, parents help their children before going to school, which means their decisions are based mostly on the parents' opinion and can not help a child to become responsible. Whereas, it is more beneficial when at teenage age people are forced to decide between different choices by themselves to advance. ",No,Yes,6.5

Some experts believe that it is better for children to begin learning a foreign language at primary school rather than secondary school,"There are people who believe that International language should be introduced in junior classes rather than senior classes. Certainly there are merits and demerits for both the cases.

Introducing foreign language at an early age of a child will have certain beneficial impacts for an example - An individual will be confident to talk to any foreign people because he/she will be master in that language because he/she has been learning since childhood. Secondly a child will have a vast knowledge about that particular language because the child gets enough time to master the language. Thirdly, the by the time to master a child who start to learn a foreign language at a primary school will be one step ahead from the child who starts from a secondary school as there can be a situation where a person needs to interact with a person who is a foreigner, so in this case a child who has been learning the foreign language since his primary school can respond to the foreigner immediately.

However there are certain drawback of learning foreign language at a primary school for an example at an early age a child needs to focus on studies and even on co- cirricular activities as well so introducing a new language might be a pressurizing one. Secondly at an early age a child is not enough matured to understand so it might be difficult for them.

In conclusion, I think a child can learn a foreign language at a primary school as another additional subject. If a proper guidance is given at an initial stage a child can learn a foreign language. ",No,No,5.5

But sometimes there are situation that make this message have negative impact for children.

From the one side, this message is useful for everyone especially for children, cause this message told them to be more productive in their live, doing a good activity and always have a positive thinking on the future of their live. After take the message the children will applied the message in their activity, make them always encourage their skill and do a positive activity. Example, when this message is giving to the children, especialy who want to be a soccer players in the future, so this message will always support them to practice to play soccer every day.

Nowadays people are trying to have a successful career and happy family life at the same time. What problems could this create? How can people overcome them? Give reasons for your answer and include relevant examples from your personal knowledge or experience.,"In today's world, everyone wants everything in their life. They want to be rich as well as a comfortable lifestyle. In this essay, we will discuss the problems that could be occurred on the path of success and how we can come out from it and achieve our goals and get success in our life. First of all. I really believe that people suppose to be ambitious in their life and all human beings deserve a comfortable and successful life. As we know, every success comes from hard work. So, everyone should be doing hard work to get their goals real in their lives. Hard work is the key to success. Sometimes people get frustrate and stop following their targets. If we take the example of an American survey of 2019, It shows that 60% of people lost their confidence after their first failure in their life. we have to accept that failure is part of life and it is also very important to get success in life because failure is the best teacher of our life which learn us how we can face the worst situations in our lives.

On another side of the coin, people can overcome their failure with the help of their family members and be focus on their targets. If we take the example of Apple the number one telecommuting company. However, the owner of this company, Steve Jobs also face so many ups and down to get success in his life. when he was working with one telecommuting company he created this idea to develop new software which is different from others but nobody wants to believe on him but he did not stop and he started his own company and created his own telecommuting device and as we know Apple is one of the leading telecommunicating company of the world. So, always be confident in yourself.

In conclusion, I pen down by saying that everyone can achieve everything and become successful and happy in their life if they will follow their dreams and always be truthful to their family members. ",No,Yes,6.5
There is no denying the fact that money plays a crucial role in our lives. Children are too young to...,"It is believed by most parents that teaching the importance of money to children at a young age is necessary. I completely agree with that view and will give my opinion in the following paragraphs.

On the one hand, most kids today often do not understand the value of money. This often comes from their families, some parents think that children are too young to understand about money, or some are too busy to teach them. Thus, children will tend to be wasteful, looking down on some things or some kind of people. For instance, most children immediately want a toy or food as soon as they see it and they throw angry if their desire is not fulfilled. They do not care if the parents have the resources to buy them what they want, in some cases when they are not met by their parents, it also leads to negative actions. It is necessary to teach they know how much hard work goes into earning each penny. Only then they would appreciate the things which they have.

On the other hand, children also need to be taught the wisdom of handling money. Therefore, they will not be deceived by bad intentions, nor will they suffer financial crisis in their adulthood. Families need to teach them how to save and manage money well. For example, parents should assign household chores to their children and reward them when finished. Hence, kids will respect what they do, work harder and try to save. Just like that, in the future they will become independent people and often wise against bad temptations.

To summarize, it is essential to teach children about the value of money from an early age. That brings so many good benefits to their future. ",No,No,6.5
Discuss the causes and effects of pressure on children today,"Do you know the situations that have put pressure on children lately? Each child is affected differently as a result of these pressures and may show different reactions. Moreover, some of the reasons why children are under pressure can have bad consequences. Therefore, I will talk about the reasons and their impact that put pressure on children in this essay.

The first cause of pressure on children today is the parents' expectation of the child. If these expectations are too high for the child's capacity, children may become stressed out for fear that their parents will be disappointed. These can have bad consequences for the child. They may experience stress-related health problems such as depression and anxiety disorder, weight gain, or unhealthy weight loss. In addition to all these physical consequences, children who feel inadequate may be unsuccessful or unwilling to live

The second cause may be the problems children have with their friends. While these problems cause asociality and shyness, the pressures that are the result of these problems that children experience will affect all relationships they will experience in the future.

In conclusion, the effects of pressure on children can lead to psychological and physical problems that are difficult to correct if not recognized and acted upon. ",No,No,6.5
Today family members do not eat meals together. Why does this happen? Is this a positive or negative development Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience,"In this world, nowadays life will become very fast. So, sometimes people have not eat full of day due to work load. This is the reason why family members not eat meals at same time. Also, it will have negative impact on society.

Firstly, The main reason for this today in any family maximum people have to work. Therefore timing of there working hours have different so it will affect the family time. In addition any nuclear family the both parents have to work for there better life and they did not have time for doing such that things. Eventually it will leads to impact on children mental condition. As well as Children may not have feelings for family bonding and other things.

In earlier times, family manage the timing for eat meals together. As a result of these people can share many things. Not only sharing but they have bonding for there family and parents can take care of there children by giving them a time.

Sometimes family breakdown has cause to not giving time to family and it has first stage is to not eat meals together at any time. I have read some article in newspaper they say that many family did break for only for not giving proper time to family.

All in all it will say that eating meals together will give positive impact for family and is has no any positive development in life. However in India there are some family or community which can always eat together at least once in a day. ",No,No,5
"People think children should make own decisions to become independent, others believe they become selfish. Discuss both views and share your opinion.","People argue that children should be able to decide what to want to wear, eat and watch to make them independent, however, others believe that the freedom merely make them selfish. In my opinion, I definitely agree that it is vital for children to have liberty in implementing their thoughts, although, they are too young to distinguish between good and bad, parents must help them with taking the right decision.

Firstly, it is extremely crucial for adolescents to know how to my their own choices in lifestyle or future career, as it paves a successful path in their life. In addition, which the decisions they make, understand about their consequences and will lead to taking responsibilities of their own actions. The abilities and the freedom to make choices will promote them in dealing conflicts and challenges in the real world as they grow up.

On the contrary, it is believed that adolescents with the freedom to do things on their own will make them insensitive towards others feelings. They start thinking merely about themselves and never care about others emotions. If a child is rendered with doing everything as his wish and parents given the liberty to put his choices on top priority it may lead affecting others. For instance, while watching TV with family, the child will always put his likes first and start watching his favorite cartoon and will never think of bothering to care about what the left of the family want to watch. Therefore, it is crucial for a guiding support to be added for kids.

In the conclusion, children must be given the freedom to make their own decisions taking into regard the consequences and helping them as a guiding source from behind by their parents. ",No,Yes,6.5
"Some people think that parents should teach children how to be good members how to be good members of society. Others, however believe that school is the place to learn this.
Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","The said topic is debatable as some individuals argued that parents must teach their kids regarding the good manners while others think that school is the best place to learn this skill. However, i would elaborate both these mentioned perspectives in upcoming paragraphs.

First and foremost reason of why parents should encourage their children to becoming a great member of society is that parents are considered as a first teacher of children. Therefore, a child can learn many moral values from home such as respect, patience, politeness and so on. Another reason is that, children are spent most of their time along with their parents at home and they learn everything from their own parents. so, parents should set example of good member in the society which would further encourage their children to follow the good behavior of parents.

On the other hand, it is true that, teachers are also responsible for making the children's good reputation in the society because they learn living in the discipline at school which would be fruitful in their future. In addition to this, school can be make additional subject regarding the social interaction. For instance, sociology is a informative subject of society.

To put it in a nutshell, i pen down by saying that, providing a knowledge of good manners to students is indispensable in order to make a safe and secure society to live. Hence, i opine that, both parents and teachers should teach them moral lessons. ",No,No,6.5
Modern lifestyles means that parents have little time for their children.Many children suffer more than children in the past as their parents are not caring about them,"The lifestyle of the modern day is considered as a period in which parents are too busy to have any time for their own children. Many of the people including me, believe that today's children are suffering more than their past counterparts from lack of attention of their parents due to increasing work pressure and extra working hours.

The increasing amount of work pressure not only in workplace but also at home is becoming one aspect of our daily lives and working as the number one barrier between child and parent. Because of huge responsibility of work parents are lacking to have enough time for their children as they made a misconception about modern lifestyle. As a result they are procrastinating and consider the business life as the most crutial thing

Secondly mainly as a consequence of parents desire to be rich and have more money than their fellows is leading them to work out of their ability at home. That is the another factor that is serving to separate the child from the parent. Due to the fact when parents are back at home from work instead of spending time with children they are always in hurry to accomplish the results they want as much as possible within the limited time. Thus, nowadays more and more children are getting disappointed owing to the fact that their parents inattentive to them

To conclude I strongly believe that a great number of parents are not giving enough care to fulfill the requirements of their children's attention seeking as a child",No,Yes,6.5
Do the advantages of family-run business outweigh its disadvantages?,"In modern life many prefer working for private sectors like family- run business to being employed by public ones. In this essay I am going to discuss both sides of this argument and then my perspective will be drawn.

On the one hand, family- run business brings adolescents a significant fundamental for them to absorb and accumulate knowledge. Furthermore, it is easy to seize the opportunity to expand their employment prospects. For instance, a well-known chain of Pho ha noi or chain of Vietnamese bread now operated by the next generation. As a result, they do not have to worry about their career because they have their own path and could cover their basic living expenses.

On the other hand, there are two main demerits about family-run business. First of all, it can cause disharmony between the older generation and younger generation. Because of being self-oriented, teenagers may want to develop their own career path not dependent on their parents or they have their own ambition so they do not want to follow their family footsteps. Furthermore, one-man businesses are more hazardous than state-owned companies. As the former investment stems from their interest or a bank loan but the latter has investment from public or other resources, consequences if a company bankrupted, private enterprise have to pay a vast loan or have huge deficit.

In conclusion, a family-run business is a good way to earn money but entrepreneurs should weigh up its pros and cons before starting up. ",No,No,6

Advantages of running a business with one’s own family members.,"There are several reasons why running a business with one’s own family members is advantageous. One of them is a strong sense of unity. It is instinctive that all family members demonstrate, share core values to the firm and go along well with each other. That is why they often have a tendency to work hard together to reach the stated goals and make their privately held family firm more successful. Secondly, family-controlled firms are often associated with greater stability in terms of employment, regardless of the economic cycle. The family members share a level of persistent commitment and engagement to the company. A family-run business also is less likely to fire employees during economic downturns. Hence, it can be assumed that family firms generally tend to keep employment levels stable and avoid downsizing. Last but not least, another advantage is decreasing cost and expenditures. Because of their blood relationship, these company members may be more willing to make financial sacrifices for the sake of the business. For instance, they may be enthusiastic about offering their wages to protect their socioemotional wealth. Briefly stated, these advantages can create an extra sense of purpose and a competitive edge for the business. ",No,Yes,6.5
Doing an enjoyable game with children is better than reading for improving skills and creativity. To what extent to you agree.,"Playing an interesting game with children is believed to have an influence on improving their aptitudes and sense of creativity more than reading. Despite this appeal, I perceive that reading has a more substantial affect on a child’s skills and level of creativity.

Although playing with children does have a positive emotional impact on them, their mental state requires a more serious approach for learning. Additionally, the proccess of learning can be traced in various complicated steps, which can only be breaking down by understanding the roots of a certain information and carefully read through them. For example, form the surface, playing chess might be seen as simply a puzzling game, whereas it there are numerous books that study the criteria and principles of chess. Consquently, playing an enjoyable game is not a better method for imroving skills and creativity.

On the other hand, the activity of reading a book can develop a child’s internal motivation to grow and prosper. Whether the book is a biography of a famous polititian or a classic novel, the information that these books contain will be reflected upon the child’s level of knowledge and awreness of the surrounding world. As a result, a better realisation of themselves can lead to a considerable improvement in their performance and therefore their skills. Thus, it is crucial for adults to motivate their children to read to succeed and thrive.

In conclusion, this essay disagrees with the belief that children’s skills and creativity can be greatly developed through playing an exciting game. It presented how games themselves have rules that require reading and carefull studying. The essay also demonstrated the influce of books on children as it widens their horizon and help them comprehend the world and themselves in a way that efficiently improve their aptitude and creativity.

Write an essay on the topic below. Your essay should be at least 300 words. You should write about both sides of the argument and support your ideas. You have 30 minutes.

Many people think that online buddies make replace for real friends however, other argue that real friends will more important for people. I strongly agree with this statement, that making friends online cannot replace real mates. In this essay, i would discuss both argument and give suitable conclusion.

Firstly, Due to having advance technology people can make huge numbers of friends. Similarly, internet provide filter option to make online friends by using different social media such as facebook, snapchat, instagram etc. For instance, a survey conducted by Nepal Government about 60% of young generation use social platform to post newsfeed as well as for chatting with stranger to make good bond between them. In addition, having this types of technology people less spend their time with locality boys.

Secondly, Offline friendship gives a lot of advantages for people. People should know each other habit, test, mind set and they are more trustable than online friends. To illustrate this, 85% of people share their problems with their real best friends less than their families because they feel easy and trustworthy for them who can present in right time and give some solution in difficult situation. Hence, spending time with real buddy can create lot of fun, and people can make their future plane, spending their quality time with them rather than chatting online.

While some people that children have to be send to school, there are many parents who think that home study is more advantageous. I am completely sure that school education has more advantages than home schooling.","While some people that children have to be send to school, there are many parents who think that home study is more advantageous. I am completely sure that school education has more advantages than home schooling.

To begin with, home education is cool for children who suffer from special diseases and they will have more attention, support, medical consulting, personal education program at home, rather than in school they will feel themselves not full-fledged. Furthermore, there are many families that live under poverty line and can not afford to send their children to school because of it is expensive to buy clothes, books, food and different stuff. For instance, in the southern regions of our country just below than 30% families study at home because of lack of finance. That’s why some families see more benefits in home schooling.

However, this advantages will be overweighed by school education advantages. Firstly, in school student will be learned by many life lessons and be better in human being. For instance, student learning how to socialize, finding new friends and develop relationship, leadership skills. Secondly, school provides a lot of activities for students like olympiads, sport activities, teambuilding projects, stem, travelling and others. This activities will give a big spectre of experience and outlook to students for their future lives. Finally, in school you grow under the professional eye of a teacher. It is obvious that students are developing from all sides and without gaps. Consequently as a result, the student will be comprehensively(переводчик) developed.

To conclude with, I strongly believe that school education has way more benefits than home education because, children will have many communication experience and will be comprehensively developed. ",No,No,6
"Some people think that the main purpose of schools is to turn children into good citizens and workers, rather to benefit them as individuals. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","People have different views about/ as to the primary goal of schools. While I agree that schools can transform children into useful members of society, I believe that they also bring benefits to students themselves.

On the one hand, turning children into useful citizens is the main purpose of schools. The primary reason is that the same core subjects such as math, literature and civic education are present in the curriculum of most schools. Children, therefore, are expected to share the same moral standards, general knowledge and skills. If all members of population were to have such criteria, society would become more stable and civilized as the crime rate would be low. If schools were to fail to equip their students with needed skills or standards, they would not become productive members of society. Thus, it is understandable why schools’ main responsibility is to producing good members of society.

On the other hand, it can argued that children themselves can reap of number of benefits. When children are taught a wide range of subjects, they can have the opportunity to become more well-rounded and widen their outlook on life. This would help them to be able to adapt to a new environment in their later life. Another benefit would be that schools are a perfect environment for students to develop their communication skill. This is largely because they are enabled to make friends with their classmates and talk to them virtually on a daily basis. This skill is considered / arguably highly beneficial for social life of children.

In conclusion, it is my view that schools not only produce good citizens for society but also bring benefits for each individual student. ",No,Yes,6.5

Nowadays some older people choose to live in retirement houses rather than living with their own children is it a positive or a negative Trend,"It is undeniable fact that nowadays, a plethora of people like to live in a joint family all over the world. It is believed by some people that in the present time, few elderly people prefer to live in oldeage homes more than living with their own children. In this essay, I shall discuss why it is a positive trend in my argument in the following paragraphs.

There are few countable reasons why some individuals choose to live in retirement homes. The first and foremost reason, which cannot be avoided, is that these days, retired people can spend some time with fellow elder in retirement house as well as they do not feel isolated. To make it more clear that most of people have hectic lifestyle and they cannot spend some time with their parents and sometimes, elderly people feel loneliness, but retirement house are the best way, they cannot feel alone in there. Another important trend is that old people can get all facilities in old age house such as medical facility, as old people need medical emergencies at any time and it is not possible to get at home. If elder individuals prefer to live in a retirement house, they can easily get all facilities in there.

Last but not the least, in the modern and advanced era, many people like to live in independent life and also some older humans refer this type of life, however they are also like to live without being dependent on anyone.

In conclusion, it can be reiterated that in the present era, some retired people choose to live in a oldeage house rather than living with their on children and it is a positive trend for them who prefer retirement house for living. ",No,No,6.5
Some people think that children should be taught history. others think they should be taught science subjects. discuss both views and give your own opinion,"There is a diversity of opinions between people about what children should

study. A part of society opines that pupil should be educated with History while

rest prefer that Science subjects should be taught to them. This essay will

discuss why former view is righteous since History empowers pupils about their

foundations as well as this essay will discuss why second view is justified

because Science helps children become better at getting employed at later

stage. Eventually, I will give my personal viewpoint.

Why the first view is justified because History if it is taught to pupils, it makes

them able to understand about their roots. Means to say, they will be educated

and aware about who they are, who were their ancestors and how did their

country grow which will enrich their candidature in future. For example, if a childis not educated about his history, he is not a completely aware child about his

origin and he cannot speak firmly about his foundations. Therefore, teaching

him History is going to help him strongly.

Why the second view is righteous since teaching the child about science makes

him confident to build a career in latest technology. Such as, engineers and

scientists are highly needed to innovate and to bring a change in the standards

of life. For example, a country having a huge number of technocrats and

Science-based professionals can compete effectively and efficiently with the

world. Thence, Science subjects if taught to pupils can bring out the scientists

within the pupils.

This essay has discussed why first viewpoint is justified because History subject

educates pupils about their origins and foundations along with it, this essay has

also discussed why latter view is righteous as science stream aids children

become academically stronger at later stage. Finally, I personally believe that

both of the subjects have their own significance and it solely depends on a child

where he finds himself better absorbed. ",No,No,6
"In some countries, teachers teach foreign language to the children of primary school. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this!? Do you think advantages overweigh the disade?","Second language acquisition is increasingly becoming a common phenomena. School teachers in numerous countries are seen teaching young pupils hardly aging 7 or 8 a second language. While, on the positive side, this approach aids in their cognitive development, academic performance and contribute in making them more proficient in the language, it is also likely to put a burden on the tender minds. On the whole, I believe this is a positive development.

Irrefutably, when children are encouraged to study a second language at a stage where they have not yet acquired their vernacular language efficiently they are likely to undergo a tough period. Reason being, language learning is, unambiguously, a complex process requires one’s in depth involvement as a single language constitutes a myriad of expressions, dialects and grammar rules. Therefore acquainting them with another yet different language can stress their young minds and there is a likelihood that they develop disliking for the school because of presence of second language learning in the curricula. For instance, I have seen many of my classmates being absent frequently just because they hated maths so similar could be the repercussion in this case.

Having said that, I am still wedded to the idea that teaching second language, if efficiently, to the young children can be incredibly beneficial. Primarily, second language acquisition aids in cognitive development of the child. Learning process involves problem solving, concentration",No,No,6
Some people believe that parents should make children read more books instead of watching TV or playing games. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"On the other hand, we should never underestimate the indispensable role of TV and video games in the time of the digitalization. Playing games and watching TV could heighten the capacity for fantasy and benefit the interaction between children and the outward environment. Images and sinh dong sounds from those media bring them joy and fun, evoke the curiosity, the desire to discover new things of the children and hence enhance the visualization as well as the observation ablility. Moreover, when the children play games that requires the coopertation between members in a team, they have to communicate. . . . . with others in order to win the game. This thereby facilitate them to know each others well, make more friends and enlarge the relationship zone. ",No,Yes,6
"It is true that in some schools learning a foreign language is compulsory. While some students may find this difficult, I completely agree with the view that this should be a discipline which all children must study.","Firstly, language breaks down communication barriers. International travel is now part of the lives of many people around the world, so it is often essential to interact with other people when travelling for work or leisure. For example, a simple thing such as asking directions will probably require a basic knowledge of the language of the country. School provides an ideal opportunity, because children find it easier than adults to acquire a new language. Therefore, the years spent at school should include the requirement to have a good grasp of a second, or even third, language.

Secondly, communication includes forming friendships. At school, taking up a language should mean a chance to arrange exchange visits between students of different nationalities or to establish chat rooms between language students using social networking sites. Using the latest leading-edge technology, students will be forced into real-life situations in which they have to rely on their linguistic ability to speak and listen to a student overseas who speaks a different language. This provides an incentive to overcome language barriers and to speak more fluently. While the school curriculum already has to cover a lot of ground, time must be allocated to studying a foreign language.

In conclusion, the school years offer a unique chance to learn another language, and so foreign languages must be a required part of the school curriculum. ",No,Yes,6.5
Do children nowadays watch too much TV?,"These day, children spend a lot of time in front of the TV. They use almost of the spare time to watch TV, which is believed to damage childrens’ eyes. We can see that, more than a half children have to were glasses to go to school, it is a lot more than in the past. Although parents always worry about that problem, they are too busy to manage the amount of time that their children watching TV.

Children nowadays watch too much TV for three reasons. Firstly, the parents are busy and put their children in front of the TV. They are very stress after hard day at work so they are too tired to play with their kids. The children will concentrate on the TV and do not make their parents annoyed. However, this can make their children addicted to TV and it is very difficult for their parents to entice children to do other activities.

Secondly, every family has television in their house and it is very easy to turn on and watch it. Therefore, when the children are at home and have nothing to do. They always choose the TV instead of playing sport or outdoor activities. Children nowadays are much lazier than in the past. They do not really like to play sport because it requires a lot of time and patience.

Thirdly, TV shows and programs are becoming more vivid and colorful, therefore children are attracted. Moreover, the content of each film are very exciting and attractive especially the cartoons. Cartoons contain fantasy characters, special effects and funny storyline.

In conclusion, children watch too much TV had led to many reson above. I think it is good if children watch TV in a short time a day and they should go out, play in the garden with friends to have more fun. Prevent watching too much TV can help the children improve their eyesight. Also, do a lot of outdoor activities can help children improve their health. ",No,No,6
Some people say that advertising encourages us to buy things that we really do not need. Others say that advertisements tell us about new products that may improve our lives. Which view point do you agree with?,"People' opinions are divided about the effects of advertising on theme, whether it pushes them spending their money on needless products, or it help them find product that makes living better. I totally agree that advertisement inform us about a product to get an idea before purchasing.

Many people believe that advertisements pushes people to purchase needless products. The ultimate aim of advertisements is to subtly persuade people to buy things by creating an artificial wants. An advert of Appel IPhone, as a case in point, will conceive the consumer about buying the last version just for un extra features integrated within, like a higher image quality, even though he have the previous version of the IPhone he will queue in front of Apple company to buy one. Therefore, advertisements in most cases promote product that does not meet consumers' needs in the first place. However, advertising is irresponsible anyway for that, consumers supposed to be mature when buying things.

Other people, in the other hand, think that advertising promotes useful product that can enhance life quality. Companies aim to provide comfort to its consumers by its products. Indeed, it always think to integrate features, such us efficiency, time reduction, easiness in use, in their products. For instance, housewares production has been developing for decades to design tools making cooking faster and easier compared to the ancient kitchen tools with which woman used to spend hours in dish preparation.

Advertisements are everywhere affecting our lives. Discuss the subject,"Nowadays, it is a well known fact that advertisements are gaining more and more popularity among the world. In this point proponents of this view claim that ads do not affect people’s lives while competitors believe that people are being affected by ads. In my view people can be easily affected By ads for various reasons.

To begin with, people especially youngsters are being all the more exposed to ads that showing off a glamorous and luxurious lifestyle which is a far cry from reality. However, people are perpetually compare themselves with this glamorous lifestyle and they end up feeling worthless and suffering from mental disorders, such as depression. Additionally, ads showcase distorted images of beauty. This practice not only underestimate the roles and personality of the two genders, but also lead young people to eating disorders in order to reach these standards and even to suicidal tendencies.

Secondly, it is undeniable that media play a main role in our lives as we are unable to escape from them. For instance are not constrained only in television but also in radio, in our mobile phones and in digital hoards and posters on streets. This means that we are being exposed to implicit and explicit messages in every aspect of our live.

Write about the following topic. Some people say that advertising encourages us to buy things that we really do not need. Others say that advertisements tell us about new products that may improve our lives. Which viewpoint do you agree with? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. You should write at least 250 words.,"Marketing includes several methods to be broadened. One of the important method includes advertisement. Couple of people think that advertising compel us to get the rarely needed items. Some of the people believe that promoting the products aware us about several useful items. In my opinion, promotions provide much more information and make our shopping easier.

Myriads of thoughts have been shared that marketing is an unnecessary idea of selling products. Its a wastage of money as well, due to the fact, that when items are being displayed, everyone wish to have it if it is needed or not. Moreover, the sales on item is also a common way of marketing nowadays. So, these kinds of ideas compel the people to get unneeded products as well. For instance, my cousin came to know via social media about the hair chalks of several colors and she purchased it. Now it is of no use as they could not be applied properly.

On the other hand, marketing a product is playing a vital role in purchasing our routine stuffs. We are living in a busy world where no one has extra time to search and look for their required things. Promotions have made it easy for us. Also, we get the idea and information about the stuffs on the spot so, if anyone is willing to buy, its an easy way. For example, i was in need of a baby shape mold for cake as it was my son's first birthday and i was out of time as well. I noticed an advertisement of baking products right on the television and rather than searching it everywhere, I found it in a go.

To conclude, promotions of products is a time saving technique and it has made our needs of shopping much easier. ",No,Yes,6.5
"In the 21st century people are constantly exposed to news, advertisements, gossip and whatever else the media choose to project. To what degree are you affected by the media? Provide examples.","In our century more and more people are affected by the media. Analytically they are exposed b news, advertisements and gossip and this control their lifes. Personally, I am affected by the media but I want to eliminate this phenomenon.

Today, we are living in the age of consumerism. What I mean isvthat children, including me, want to spend money to buy things that they don’t even need. The companies, by showing us as many advertisements as they can, entice us to buy more. Also, in many cases the media violate our privacy. When we make an online purchase we need to reveal our personal information. Unfortunately, some people, named hackers, break into and steal this information.

Moreover, the media also affected teen girls in many ways. What I mean is that the Instagram idialize some of the celebrities. This is very bad for the girls as they might want to be one of those and they do extreme things to fulfill their 'goal'. Last but not least, all the teenagers will be obsessed with the social media. This means that they will affect negatively their health as they won’teat something in order to be thinner. As a result, they may end up in a hospital with serious health problems.

To sum up, nowdays we are exposed in news, advertisements and gossip. This phenomenon affected our lifes fully in many ways which are examined before. Personally, I am affected to the mass media in those ways but I will not let them control my life and no one should. ",No,Yes,6.5
some people say that advertising encourage us to buy things that we really donot need.Others say that advertisements tell us about new things that may improve our life,"Media is one of the very common sources to share and spread the news. There is no shadow of a doubt that Advertisement on Media promotes product sale. There currently exists a hot debate that whether the advertisement is good for the public or not.

Firstly, publishing ads on the newspaper, TV channels and social media is good for awareness of the common lay man. In this modern era, we are able to know about more things as were in Past. It is a plausible step as it provide awarness to everyone about technology and advancement in science. Every one has right on the comforts of life. If some one wants to buy items more than ones basic needs one can. It depends upon the finbancial stability rather than unawarness. It can be examplified as I have bought a refrigerator 10 years back and now when I saw add of New refrigerator which consume less electricity and can store better and keep itself odorless I immediately booked my order and purchased it.

There is a school of thought who suggest that advertisement promote the people to waste their money as they start buying items not required by them. Some of the people even buy new items by looking at the new technologies. This group concerns that compnies are making new model only for their sale it is totally wastage of money. i also wasted alot of money buying csmetics.

To encapsulate, it can be concluded although proponents are in notion that advertisemnet is not good I vehementy gain say with the above assertion that advertisement is guiding us about new inventions. ",No,Yes,6.5
"Companies spend millions each year on advertising online, in magazines and on billboards. These adverts can encourage people to buy goods that they do not really need. What are the positive and negative effects of consumerism?","Since the advent of technology, a vast amount of companies are spending their wealth on advertising their product on various websites, magazines and news channels. Most individuals especially teenagers come in their trap and end up spending their parents incentives on unusable things. This essay will shed light on pros and cons of promotion of the interest of consumers.

In the first phase, due to surge in advertisements a lot of people want to upgrade their mobile phones, cars and other commodities. Consequently, businesses get plentiful number of costumers as a result of which they need to employee people to serve them. There are numerous benefits due to all this such as there are tons of jobs available in the market, and as consumers are buying various products world economy is also growing. Last but not the least, since the past few centuries there has been an unprecedented rise in products through which the world is becoming advanced day by day. For instance, there are multiple modes of transportation available via air planes are available for covering long distance within a short span of time and for land self driving car is convenient for those who have some physical disability.

On the contrary, everyone ends up buying things they do not even require in their daily lives. For example, every teenager desires to get a new product available in the market to show their status symbol, and if they are unable to get the same they start participating in numerous bad activities such as furtiveness which has long term drawback for both the society and the individual too.

To conclude, considering the aforementioned points, though posting an advertisements have positive effects as it give rise in nation’s wealth, it also has some detrimental effects on individuals which push them to do inadequate activities. ",No,Yes,6
Some people say that advertising is extremely successful at persuading us to buy things. Other people think that advertising is so common that we no longer pay attention to it. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.,"Undoubtedly marketing plays an important role that influences their customers in purchasing their items according to the experts. However, nowadays most of the product marketers seem out of the strategy to attract their buyers say the experts. This essay will explore opinions for both sides and provide a detailed analysis and my opinion weighed more to the advertising is a game-changer to boost the sales of the products.

Advertising holds a major factor that influences customers in purchasing items because it shows promising feedback. To further explain, the feedbacks shown by the advertisement grab their customers' attention because that is how they differentiate the genuinely of the product. As the users of social media mushroomed all over the world, most companies make collaborate with celebrities and influencers for product reviews as their fans love to be up to date with their lifestyle.

Despite the above perspective, some believe that marketing is just a repetition between the products and less eye-catching for the customers. Often the commercial nowadays out of their ideas for advertising and just reuse the same concept over again. In addition to this point, other reasons include that advertising indicates unrealistic results for their products. Purchasers nowadays smarter than before and for them, the results shown in the advertisements were not enough and they need the information regarding the ingredients of the products.

In general, advertising's role in boosting sales presents the best option. Yes, the unrealistic results are shown and repetition of the advertisement will occur, but the numerous feedback provided and the reviews by the celebrities and influencers outweigh those two negatives. The best recommendation is to portray the advertisement in a creative way that could result in the highest effectiveness. ",No,No,6
"The society would benefit from a ban on all forms of advertising because it serves no useful purpose, and can even be damaging. Do you agree or disagree?","This given topic is worthwhile and frequently debated among the people. While I accept that advertising pressure and change the individual’s thinking style, however I also believe that advertising are beneficial for our economy and therefore should not be prohibited.

On the one hand, the prohibition of many kinds of advertisements can be useful for consumers and small enterprises. As we know, small enterprises lack of sufficient money in order to put finance to the advertising sector. The absence of advertisement positively impact on the growing of small companies. Undoubtedly, this fact encourage them that to produce vast variety of goods and services, then sell easily to the public. Secondly, consumers will also benefit from banning on the advertisement. According to the many surveys evidence, majority of consumers tend to buy same commodities, because they watch advertising on TV and their consideration are based on the ad. Due to the abolishing of ads, nothing can force to the consumer’s mind.

On the other hand, the expansion of economy would be depend on advertisement.

As far as we know, most well known companies spend a huge amount of money to the advertisement. Even, some brend campaigns put the most proportion of their income to this field, obviously, initial goals are the recognition of their products all over the world. ",No,Yes,6.5
Successful companies use advertisements to make more sales. What can make an advertisement effective? Do you think advertisements are a bad thing or a good thing for society?,"Nowadays, advertising plays a vital role for all entrepreneurs in the world. Promoting goods or services is one of the parts of the Marketing mix and many marketologists are involved in this process to conquer new market trades. In this essay I will analyze the causes that make advertisement effective and give my opinion about the impact ad on society.

It’s a well-known issue on how to enhance ad politics and make new patrons of firms. We can rely on fundamental knowledge from the basic syllabus of ´Marketing´, where we have to depict our customers via researching personal needs, preferences, targets, and interests. After the investigation specialists can get some results and on top of that, they can understand future patrons better compared to the past. Besides, they can develop a new plan with focused ads that appeal to new clients. For instance, the ´Citroen´ vehicle firm had created a new flamboyant ads company that attracted new business clients this year.

From my point of view, having excellent ads can lead to opening new branches. It has a good impact if it doesn’t contradict to law and society rules. Many companies propose new goods and only via this promo materials populace may recognize bargains or valuable and handy things, which in turn eases their life. For instance, in Ukraine on all local TV channels the Government always excludes prohibited promo materials that contradict the common law.

All in all, an excellent and detail-oriented ads approach may have a profitable impact on new consumers. There’re lots of factors that can impact on future consumers, that is why each entrepreneur must mull over future marketing strategies. I recommend that entrepreneurs have to be up to date with consumers' needs and interests. ",No,Yes,6.5
Some people say that advertising encourages us to buy things that we really do not need. Others say that advertisements tell us about new products that may improve our lives. Which viewpoint do you agree with?,"Some people argue that advertisement force them to buy unnecessary things. While other find out it to improve knowledge about new products. In this essay I will discuss about both point of view and give my opinion.

Let start with pros of advertisement. Firstly, It gives ideas and specification of new products. For Example, Smart phone advertisement gives us idea about new features available in latest smart phone so we can compare features between different smart phone. Secondly, we can compare price of same product provided by different companies. For Example, Fragrance spay has provided by different companies like Axe, Mankind and Old Dutch. So, we can compare price and save some money.

Furthermore, Advertisement helpful to solve day to day life problems. We never know about Fevikwik can fix any broken Stuff. Due to Advertisement, we get to know how to use this product and importance in our daily life. There are many products available in market which is very helpful to our daily life. Without advertisement we were never aware of that products.

On the other hand, some time due to attractive advertisement we buy things which is not useful in day-to-day life. When give advertisement with large discount, attract people to buy unnecessary things. When we saw large discount on toys, gadget and decoration products, we buy it and later on found as an extra stuff in our house.

If individual take care of their budget and only buy necessary things. Then advertisement is helpful to save money and give knowledge of new products. So, Pros overweight the cons. ",No,No,5.5
ome of the methods used in advertising are unethical and unacceptable in today’s society. To what extent do you agree with this view?,"The world that we live in today is dominated by advertising. Adverts are on television, on the World Wide Web, in the street and even on our mobile phones. However, many of the strategies used to sell a product or service can be considered immoral or unacceptable.

To begin with, the fact that we cannot escape from advertising is a significant cause for complaint. Constant images and signs wherever we look can be very intrusive and irritating at times. Take for example advertising on the mobile phone. With the latest technology mobile companies are now able to send advertising messages via SMS to consumers' phones whenever they choose. Although we expect adverts in numerous situations, it now seems that there are very few places we can actually avoid them.

A further aspect of advertising that I would consider unethical is the way that it encourages people to buy products they may not need or cannot afford. Children and young people in particular are influenced by adverts showing the latest toys, clothing or music and this can put enormous pressure on the parents to buy these products.

In addition, the advertising of tobacco products and alcohol has long been a controversial issue, but cigarette adverts have only recently been banned in many countries. It is quite possible that alcohol adverts encourage excessive consumption and underage drinking, yet restrictions have not been placed on this type of advertising in the same way as smoking.

It is certainly true to say that advertising is an everyday feature of our lives. Therefore, people are constantly being encouraged to buy products or services that might be too expensive, unnecessary or even unhealthy. In conclusion, many aspects of advertising do appear to be morally wrong and are not acceptable in today's society. ",No,Yes,6.5
Some people say that advertising is extremely successful at persuading us to buy things. Other people think that advertising is so common that we no longer pay attention to it. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.,"In the contemporary world, advertising industry has become worldwide. While there are some who believe that ads have a significant impact on what people purchase, others hold the notion that individuals are not affected by them as much as they used to. In this essay, both views will be discussed following by a drawn conclusion.

To embark on, there are manifold reasons which can be put forward to advocate the high influence of advertising. First and foremost is that it seems that the more one specific good is advertised, the more people are convinced to buy that. Take brands as an example, citizens normally are enthusiastic to pay for them since they are surrounded by a myriad of ads encouraging people to do that. besides that, it is a fact that usually, enterprises seek their profit. So it should be profitable for them to advertise their products on the media since normally it is considerably expensive to introduce their products on television and other sorts of media to residents.

On the other hand, many argue that this industry is not successful to draw the attention of people anymore. Their primary reason is that people grew accustomed to seeing them everywhere so they have become broning to them. as a result they are not effective. To explain more, when families are watching their favorite TV show and it suddenly is interrupted by an advertising video they would change the channel.

To put it into a nutshell, I pen down saying that, although people do not focus on the ads, from my prespective they are still influensive on our decision when it comes to shopping. ",No,No,6

"In recent times, many people have focused on the negative effects advertising has on children’s health, behaviour and family relationships. Advertising to children should be banned. To what extent do you agree?","Advertising to children should be banned as it can lead to many negative effects on children’s behavior, health and family relationship. In many cases the messages in the ads makes the children have wrong belief. Ads create a need for them to own the product which they need. Parents who are unable to handle the temper and tantrums have the tendency to buy the children what they need. This can increase financial issues for low income families. If the parents deny, children may become disgruntle and this can cause low-esteem because their parents are unable to buy expensive products. Exposure to Ads results in children getting used to lifestyle as shown in media. Children get attracted to high end brands that show shoes, clothes and other costly products due to which they disregard the low –end products. There are too many attractive commercial which are marketing junk food and beverages which can affect children’s health. This leads to other major health issues like heart problems, diabetes and other issues. There are many marketing messages which can be percieved as truths and can stay until they become adults. Exposure to all types of ads can harm the children. Ads can also lead to major change in children’s behaviour. The effect of ads can be serious on children if they are frequently exposed to them. Things like video games and expensive toys can have a negative impact on child’s development and behavior. The exposure of such high-end, unreasonable products can make the child very demanding. For the sake of children’s health and development, we should consider imposing a ban on ads. ",No,Yes,6.5
"These days, some schools do not have enough money to pay for all the programs that they think are necessary for their students. As a result, some schools are considering allowing advertisements in their buildings. Do you think this is a good idea? Why or why not?","Many educational institutes and schools are pro-active and arrange different kinds of programs and events for the betterment and the development of the students studying there. Sometimes, they run out of sufficient funds and try to generate revenues through the adverts, branding, and promotional activites in their premises. I think this is not a bad idea yet the schools should think twice before allwoing them to utilise their premises.

Firstly, the adverts shown in the schools have a very deep and ever-lasting impact on the mindset of the studetns. Thus, if the schools welcome the products that may benefit their students, it will be an added feather on the hat. For example, the advertisement of cetrain nutritional food itmes such as Milk-Powder, Protien- Bar, Fruits, and Vegetables will have a dual advantage for the schools. On the one hand, they may generate a good amount of income and on the other hand, such advertising may encourage the students to eat well and stay healthy. This will also be beneficial if the advert is of the inaugration of the gym or the sports center.

Secondly, the promotions of many products such as senitary napkins and sanitizers will educate students too about personal hygiene and spread awareness among them and as a result from the very young age, students will start developing good habits. Thus, schools and teaching institutes shall always invite and promote educational promotions even if they are not in the need of money.

However, it is observed that many pupils demads unexpectedely after seeing such as ads. For instance, the promtion of Parker pen in schools may compel parents to buy such expensive pens if if the children are not required.

Hence, it is always a good idea to enable corporates to advertise their products to increase the sales yet the school authorites shall always keep a close eye for their positive and negative effects on their students. ",No,No,6

While on the other side of the coin see a fruitful outcome from advertising as it provides knowledge of new products and better alternatives to exciting old products which impart an easy lifestyle. As long as my point of view concerns, I would like to go with the positive side of the coin. I believe that the advertisement makes our life easier. I would like to elaborate more on this as below.

Out of all the arguments, the strongest one to prove my point of view is a commercialization help people to choose their option out of wide range. for instance, In the early years when televisions and the internet are not in use as marketing, people used to fixed timing news on television. Nowadays people start using mobile phones and different applications for news as well. They can read and listen to the news anytime and anywhere.

In addition to that, now some television advertisements show the adverse effect of consuming tobacco. It educates people about health awareness. People stop consuming tobacco. On the other hand, people also become diet conscious after watching different healthy food advertisements like PUFA oil, Fiber-rich Food, sugar-free biscuits. As a result, people start living a healthy lifestyle.

Modernization in commercialization help to protect the environment. People start going paperless world. Stop hurting the environment.

This essay will provide different views about the benefits and the drawbacks.

Advertising can be beneficial as it is the foundation for the success of a company.

From an economic point of view, advertising is a key part of the growing and expanding business. To be specific, it helps to publicize so the products

companies can approach their target clients to persuade them by Showing accurate instructions of the products. Lacking widespread instructions, consumers cannot decide on what to choose and how to use, whilst businessmen cannot raise the revenue. According to my knowledge, people can easily find information about products on google and Facebook since they have been running advertisements for other brands to enhance income.

Far from being advantageous, the harmful effects of advertising on our society should be mentioned. First of all, because companies manipulated consumers’ choices to purchase their products, advertisements are usually focused on selling brand images convincing people about the benefits.

Therefore, there are high chances of people being fraud to buy useless things. Another flaw is that Advertisements are focusing on children, which are the naive ones. As a result, after watching commercials children tend to the pestering of nagging parents to buy toys, snacks, and other goods causing bad behavior to children.

In conclusion, my firm belief is that advertising is detrimental for its invasive and manipulation regardless of the informative purpose. ",No,Yes,6.5
Some people say that advertising encourages us to buy things that we really do not need. Others say that advertisements tell us about new products that may improve our lives. Which viewpoint do you agree with?,"Advertising is indeed an excellent way to introduce products in the market. But the fact can not be denied that people end up buying unnecessary products. Attractive commercials can be seen all over the internet, flyers, newspapers and television, where it can be challenging to neglect the desire of having more than one need.

Increasing social media marketing strategies encourage individuals to buy unwanted things now than ever before as purchasing is one click away on the internet. New user discount is another way to have more customers on online websites. Constant images and popups can be intrusive and irritating while working online. One of the most concerning part is, companies only shows positive sides of their products which can not guarantee satisfaction until they are used.

The biggest hit by this era is middle class families who are already working hard to meet their ends. But their children are sensitive and easily influenced by these advertisement which results in demands of useless things such as toys, video games, superhero equipment and so on. Last but not least, there are much more sources available to improve life of mankind but advertisement is one sided attractive arrangement that is not enough to know about product.

"These days, people are bombarded with advertisements on various types of the media. Views differ on the implications of advertising","These days, people are bombarded with advertisements on various types of the media. Views differ on the implications of advertising, but I would argue that there are both positives and negatives in equal measure.

On the one hand, there are three primary benefits of advertising to society. First, thanks to commercials, customers can be informed of newly-launched products. In other words, they are aware of the array of selections available to their demands; otherwise, they are confined to only a narrow range of products. Another noticeable advantage is that companies can approach prospective customers, capturing more market share and business growth. In addition, the expansion of advertising in various forms creates far-reaching employment opportunities, ranging from designing, photography to content-writing. On a large scale, advertising serves as a bridge between manufacturers and customers, expanding business opportunities and raising living standards.

Despite the aforementioned merits, advertising could pose some threats to customers. First, advertising can be deceiving. Marketers can employ tricks and gimmicks to incite people to buy products which can be of poor quality, leading to great dissatisfaction among buyers. Furthermore, advertising drives up the price of products. This is because the selling price of marketed items need to cover the advertising expenses. In addition, advertising tempts people to purchase unnecessary things. Customers might find it hard to resist the temptation of products which are advertised way beyond their expectations.

In conclusion, the development of businesses has given rise to the growing number of advertisements, and this trend is, in my opinion, advantageous as well as detrimental. ",No,Yes,6.5
"Some people believe that advertisements are deceptive. On the other hand, they increase product sales. Discuss and give your opinion.?","In this modern world advertisement plays a very important role in trading and business. While many people admit that advertisements are misleading. The substantial influence of this trend has sparked the controversies over the potential impact in recent years. I suppose, advertisements are very essential in order to increase the industrialization and world sales. In this essay, I will elaborate my views on the statement and end with a logical conclusion.

Firstly, advertisement mainly increases the demand of the product which leads to more supply. Because of this there will be increase in global markets revenue. From big to small traders everyone use advertising as an important tool in order to grow their business. This impact on people leads to better standard of living and educates them in all aspects of the product. For example, sanitizers nowadays has become more into use which was only after advertisement, before the corona pandemic more than half of the world’s population are unaware of it. This way it is educating people, improving the living standards and importantly ‘Revenue, ’ as consumers are more for the product.

On the other hands, advertisement employees the jobless liking bringing up entrepreneurs, content writers, web designers and what more. Moreover, the production of goods or products mainly depends on the way the of promotion and content that is provided on the product. However, few advertisements like tobacco, alcohol seem to be disturbing. Provided, certain limits and implementing restrictions on such products cannot influence people in anyway. Nevertheless, hardly any may cause deleterious effects on people, while others are unavoidable.

In conclusion, the fact that advertisement enhances the quality and quantity of sales cannot be ignored. Although adds has got several disadvantages, the impact created on its launch and promotion of the product overweighs them. ",No,Yes,6.5

On the one hand, there are certain many reasons why for company decided using advertising tools to symphasise their products. First and foremost, the products value is improved thanks to the advertising. In fact, the products are advertisered in TV, radio, even social media always get a highly recommened for customers. Secondly, it is extremely clear for viwers when access detail related to products in advertising tools. Obviously, throughly advertisement so that a large amount of people can know clearly about the products they etheir want or do not want to buy.

Despite the aforementioned benefits, using advertising also bring both businesses and customer numerous negative. Firstly, customers face to buy low-quality product and loss the faith with advertisiment. The products with high cost but the quality not good, for example, marketing programme introduce a perfect product with buyer and take the truth into products of them, but after all these bad products are bought by buyer. Furthermore, the company may be lost their position in market. It is undeniable that a huge customer are lost and the company have to cope with reduce sale.

Advertisements may have made everyone want to possess the same items,"Advertisements may have made everyone want to possess the same items, but they did not eliminate individuals' distinctive qualities or behaviors. Nowadays, everyone has the same things, be it the same fashion trends, the same manner of dressing, or similar eating choices. However, this does not that advertisements have obliterated people's separate personalities and behaviors. Although we can all wear the same outfit, the way we wear it and behave in different situations is different.

On the one hand, advertising campaigns can be beneficial in some ways. Firstly, this field is likely to generate a variety of employment opportunities for people. For example, Vinamilk, the largest dairy company is Vietnam, last year launched a campaign to promote their new products, which employed hundreds of individuals working for its promotion. Secondly, advertisements provide a wealth of useful information about products such as price, application and origin. This helps customers choose purchases that is suitable for their demands. If there is no advertising, they would feel a narrow range of choices when shopping.

On the other hand, I believe that the potential drawbacks of advertising programs are more significant. Primarily, nowadays, to maximize their profits, companies are willing to exaggerate the information about their products they provide to the market to persuade customers. As a result, buyers are more likely to buy products that do not meet their expectations, which leads to a negative attitude among customers towards these products and advertisements. In addition, because of the high cost for advertising programs on TV or the internet, the price for each products tends to increase dramatically. This makes customers have to spend more money on the same goods, putting them under financial pressure.

In conclusion, despite the belief that the popularity of advertising activities can have several advantages, I am of the opinion that its disadvantages are greater. ",No,Yes,6
"we are surrounded by advertising . some people think that this is good because it gives us choices as consumers ,but others argue that it makes people selfish and greedy for more and more goods.do you think that there should be less advertising?","Advertisements encourages the buyers to purchase products with a wide range.

Those are the objective reasons why a product advertising is effective. In my own view, here are some good reasons why advertising is a success.

The first thing that Orion succeeded was to pinpoint Chocopie's main audience, thus giving the most relevant advertising messages. The second thing that caused the commercial's success was that Orion was able to touch the hearts of television viewers. From the song to the story is told around the word ""love"" to up play the message Orion wants to convey, which is ""love liking Chocopie"".

A number of people, even children, are attracted to TV advertising. Therefore, a successful advertising must be an advertisement that comes to the heart of the viewer, the customer.

"Some people say that advertising prompt us to purchase unnecessary items. Others say that advertisement tell us about new products that may benefit our lives.
","In the 4. 0 era, so many products are created. So advertisement has become the method that could introduce the products to people. Some people say that advertising prompt us to purchase unnecessary items. Others say that advertisement tell us about new products that may benefit our lives.

On the one hand, advertising may make people buy things that regardless their needs. Absolutey, advertising put pressure on people to purchase new products. The advertisers use delightful contents, creating vivid images or celebrity endorsement. These disposition influence subconsious mindset of consumers then trigger demand for items. For representation, smartphone labels manipulate the advertisement to make people feel a need to buy the lastest one even though the current phone still functions perfectly.

Nevertheless, I would argue that advertising plays a cruial role in introducing products which are beneficial to people’s lives. Nowadays, innovative products are invented more and more everyday and advertising is the best process to allow them reach out to many consumers. It makes our lives more convenience and change people’s lifestyles. For instance, drive-sharing applications like Grab, Uber, …. . are becoming well-known. They change te behavior of millions of consumers around the world, help us to book cars more easily, especially more convenient and the prices are cheaper than the traditional one.

To sum up, advertisement has 2 sides view, but anyway I think it ís an useful information source that helps us to update our knowledge and ìnformation everyday, it also makes our lives become easier. ",No,Yes,6.5
Today different kinds of advertising influence our life. Do the negative effects of this development outweigh the positive?,"Nowadays many types of TV and other social media promotions are impacts in our life. This concept has more negative sides than positive. The upcoming paragraph will justify how disadvantages surpass the advantages.

My initial argument in favour of this concept being more disadvantageous is that there are some concerning effects of advertisement on people. In other words, commercials promote people to consume everything by telling public that they feel better or all will be good. As a result of that people impulsively spend too much money, which result in the fact into debt. For instance, with the innovative methods of advertising strategies, the number of people, who are in debt, increased dramatically. Therefore, it is justified idea that advertisement have negative effects on consumers.

In addition to the above point that these days advertisements impacts can be seen on children group by regularly changing in their habits. The food company ads attracting them to eat preservative foods, due to this it gets famous among the teenagers. For example, companies do the promotion very tactfully, they offer free toy or scan code (for video game) with the item, due to this they insist for buy to their parents. Moreover, present generation is getting diverting from originality and becoming unhealthy.

However, it is observed that some beneficial sides also there in some extent by advertising. It informs us about the choices we have and the use of the products. For instance, before finalising the product we can compare the product prices and specifications. Moreover, this attraction also can be a bluff. However, this can be overcome by putting some legalities by government on promotion companies.

To conclude, despite of some benefits, there are more drawbacks of advertisements. I completely support the view that advertisements affect the lives of people in the negative way because of the cause of debt",No,No,6.5
Advantages of advertisements,"On the one hand, advertisements bring several great benefits. First, it provides consumers with a variety of options for the products that they need to buy. Consumers have different perspectives and preferences for products, including types, prices and the like. Advertising enables the newly-launched or on-sale products to reach potential customers. Therefore, it gives people more opportunities to make comparisons and select their choice more easily. In addition, the advertising industry can help to create more employment opportunities. In recent years, the development of this industry has provided occupations for many creative people, especially artists, painters or copywriters who major in designing and thinking of ideas for advertisements. As a result, the unemployment rate would be much higher without it. ",No,Yes,6
Many business centers consider advertisements as a good way to develop,"Nowadays, the business community often underlines in their advertising leaflets that their goods are the newest items in some ways. There are some causes why this phenomenon occurs. Despite this, I believe that it is an adverse development because it has the potential to confuse clients and cause them to lose trust in advertisements.

There are a variety of different factors that may have led businesses to point out that the products they manufacture are new to some extent. One of the major causes can be that by this, many businessmen want to attract customers' attention in order to raise their sales’ shares. It is an undeniable fact that people usually tend to pay attention to advertisements that say they have some brand new products, which just bring benefits to entrepreneurs because it helps them to make more money. Furthermore, ever-increasing competition rates in the business field can cause businesses to stand out among dozens of other traders. In other words, to compete with others, businessmen need something unique such as advertisements emphasising that their products are new to make their content more attractive. Hence, competition and businesses’ willingness to make a great profit cause this phenomenon to appear.

In my opinion, however, this trend cannot be considered as a positive development. Firstly, by drawing attention to possessing fresh products, businesses are unfair towards their clients. This is because such behavior of business owners can mislead those who follow advertisements’ context and buy products, believing that it is new. Moreover, the rate of disappointed customers may significantly increase since they may feel cheated if businesses ‘ products are not new as it is said in advertising materials, which consequently decreases people’ credibility to business community advertisements.

To sum up, business people commonly highlight in their commercial ads that their products are new. Although there are some obvious reasons, I would have to support the idea that this phenomenon is a negative development because it can mislead customers and they will no longer trust such advertisements.

Firstly, advertising supports companies to increase sales. Thanks to advertising, products and services are widely introduced to customers. High-quality advertisements might attract potential customers and encourage them to use the advertised goods. For example, several young people could spend a lot of money because of their idols’ appearance on the advertisements of some products.

Moreover, for customers, promotions and advertising help them save time and money to choose necessary products and services.

Additionally, that also affect customer's choice as well as profit margins of institutions. Hence, numerous people believe that advertisements should be restricted, however; some believe that they should be present due to their immense benefits.

To commence with, it can be seen in various public's opinion that they opted for the presence of ads due to several reasons. The first and foremost reason behind their belief is that advertisements give choices to general people. Additionally, in current era, people are sufficent able to verify about the product's and features such as on internet or public reviews on social media platforms. So, there are less chances that they will go for wrong products after seeing the ads. The second reason behind their belief is that advertisments also increase the selling of products within the short period of time. For instance, due to wide availablity of advertising platforms in current era, numerous startups have got success in India within few months or quaters. The third reason behind their belief is that advertisment itself is a big sector so that it provides the employment to creative as well as normal people. Hence, due to immense benefits of ads, people think that it should be present in upcomming days.

On the contrary, although, there are many benefits of advertisments, some people believe that disadvantages are more so that it should be banned. The primary reason why they belive so is that most of the times ads disturbs the viewers. Additionally, frequent ads in between the television shows is also irritating the people. The secondary reason behind their belief is that massive sponsorships for advertising the products increases the burden on companies. Consequently, at the end, buyers or public have to spend more money to buy these kinds of products. For instance, according to the survey, most cosmetic companies spend their 60% of thier revenue on the advertisments. So, if they had not put ads about products, the prices of these products would be significatly low compared to the current price. Hence, ads may increase the price of products as well as irritates the viewers so that some people think that these should be banned.

In conclusion, although, ads have some disadvantages, we should not forget their advantages before making any decesion. Moreover, due to the plenty of benefits which are associated with ads such as increase in selling, provides choices, give employments and many more so that more people agree on the presence of ads.

Model Essay for IELTS - Advertising,"The world that we live in today is dominated by advertising. Adverts are on television, on the World Wide Web, in the street and even on our mobile phones. However, many of the strategies used to sell a product or service can be considered immoral or unacceptable.

To begin with, the fact that we cannot escape from advertising is a significant cause for complaint. Constant images and signs wherever we look can be very intrusive and irritating at times. Take for example advertising on the mobile phone. With the latest technology mobile companies are now able to send advertising messages via SMS to consumers' phones whenever they choose. Although we expect adverts in numerous situations, it now seems that there are very few places we can actually avoid them.

A further aspect of advertising that I would consider unethical is the way that it encourages people to buy products they may not need or cannot afford. Children and young people in particular are influenced by adverts showing the latest toys, clothing or music and this can put enormous pressure on the parents to buy these products.

In addition, the advertising of tobacco products and alcohol has long been a controversial issue, but cigarette adverts have only recently been banned in many countries. It is quite possible that alcohol adverts encourage excessive consumption and underage drinking, yet restrictions have not been placed on this type of advertising in the same way as smoking.

It is certainly true to say that advertising is an everyday feature of our lives. Therefore, people are constantly being encouraged to buy products or services that might be too expensive, unnecessary or even unhealthy. In conclusion, many aspects of advertising do appear to be morally wrong and are not acceptable in today's society. ",No,Yes,6.5
Some of the methods used in advertising are unethical and unacceptable in today’s society. But some methods are fine. Discus both view and give your opinion,"In recent decades, there has been a growing concern from customers about forms of advertising. This has led to the question of whether some of the advertisements are transmitted unethical and unacceptable to consumers. In this essay, I will elaborate several reasons why I entirely agree with this statement.

To begin with, from the birth of the fundamental advertising industry sapling to the development of various forms of advertising obviously took millennia. Thereby, there have been changes in the forms of advertising which serve basic human needs and do not have inappropriate negative methods. First and foremost, almost all agency companies would use the strategy of celebrity endorsement, which has huge fame in public relations. To illustrate, those influencers probably take pictures with the products of their companies in order to brain awareness to purchasers. With this course of actions, the new brand could easily find the target audience, as well as capture the clients’ real reactions when using products. Additionally, new businesses can also totally attract customers with quality content. There are merits ways of transport information including mass media, words of mouth, infographics, blogs, or even video. All of them would bring their own benefit to the company.

On the other hand, there are convincing sherds of evidence that the toxic information methods from advertisements spread out significantly over decades. In fact, hundreds of exaggerated advertising, product hype are rampant in society, which brings unorthodox information and easily affects detrimentally directly to the consumers. Furthermore, to entice consumers, agencies create plenty of disadvantages by constantly sending spam messages to purchasers’ emails, associated with the data theft. A good case in point is junk mail or cold mail, containing a bunch of viruses or malicious software that could make great inroads into our computers and completely steal our portals.

In conclusion, despite different opinions on this topic, I am inclined to agree with the idea that there are many agency networks using unacceptable ways to beat the drum for their commodities. That leads to plenty of demerits of the client’s human rights so that this condition must be strictly controlled. ",No,Yes,6.5
Advertising is becoming one of the best weapons to boost product sales. What are the positives and negatives of advertisement?,"There is no doubt that business owners and companies advertise their products in order to increase their product sales. There are clearly some benefits to doing this, but it can also bring about a set of concerns.

To begin with, one major benefit of advertisement is that it helps increase product sales. [how? Or why? ] To elaborate further, when an item is promoted, it reaches out to potential customers and influences them to purchase the product. For example, Keya soap limited in Bangladesh increased 75% sales last year because they advertised their products on TV and billboards. Besides, advertising helps customers to learn about the product. This is because many advertisements carry important information such as usages and features of the product. This helps customers to buy the most effective item for them. [why]

However, advertisements can also cause some issues. The biggest problem is that it increases the product price. This is because when you want to promote your business or products, you need to hire models and pay a substantial figure to the media. Besides, advertising influences people to possess items that are not really necessary for them. This is a serious problem because this often leads people to debt. For example, many people buy products on their credit card online because of advertisements. There is proof that this has caused many credit card users, especially in the UK, suffer from a significant amount of debt.

In conclusion, although advertisements improve the figure of product sales and inform customers about valuable information about the product, it is important to consider its drawbacks such as increasing product prices and influencing people to buy unnecessary items. ",No,No,6

This essay will show the reasons why this trend happens and the benefits that businesses can gain from this marketing strategy.

The first reason why businesses usually promote that their products are new is due to the fact that they want to attract customers’ attention. In buyers’ mindset, they always think that most new things are more quality because these items have just been created with the latest manufacturing processes and these items will give buyers new experiences. Another reason is that businesses want to make difference from their competitors. In the modern world, plenty of companies are established that lead to the market will be more competitive. If a company does not renew its products, customers will switch to buy products from competitors.

The phenomenon of emphasizing products through advertising gains a large number of advantages, which may generate profit for companies. It can be denied that the demands of buyers change from time to time. Therefore, if a company launches a new product that catches up with changing customer tastes, customers will buy products. For instance, Apple always updates their iPhone each year and advertises those new items through several media such as YouTube advertisements, Twitter, Facebook, … As a result, Apple can easily draw customers' attention from many different countries and their sale volume increase significantly per year. Moreover, when their advertisements become viral, they can approach different kinds of target customers. Thus, businesses not only survive in a competitive world but also become market leaders in this industry.

In conclusion, the way that businesses use advertisements to emphasize that their items are new is given a positive development for customers and companies. This can be a great opportunity for companies to improve sales and achieve success in the modern business world. ",No,No,6.5

Some people say that customers have been completely attracted by the advertisement. Other people think that advertising is so common that we no longer pay attention to it anymore. In this essay, I will discuss both these views and give my opinion.

To begin with, advertisement is the greatest tool to persuade the customer. First, advertisement is considered as the short overview of a product which included the price, amenities of its. All the special things of a product will be inserted and stand out in an advertisement so, the customer may see it on tv or social platforms and be attracted by it. Even if the customers do not care about it, this advertisement is repeated several times and soon it may make some people finally go out and buy this product. For instance, if a person is watching television and sees new versions of ice cream so many times, they may be attracted and try it in the near future. Secondly, advertisement improves our life and makes it easier. Through advertisement, we can learn more about new products. For instance, Samsung has proposed a new version of the smartphone which is also being used by one of the greatest football players Leonel Messi. Therefore, many people who do not use Samsung before but also change their taste because of the influence of Messi.

On the other hand, it is undeniable that advertising one product too many times may lead to the ignorence of the customer. After watching a number of advertisements people will see it as a part of their day and are less likely to pay attention to it. There are several ways people can skip the advertisement such as turning off the television or turning down the volume.

ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF ADVERTISEMENTS ON TV OR THE INTERNET,"Nowadays, the development of advertising on the Internet has big impact on human life. Therefore, the below essay will outline some common advantages and disadvantages of this tendency.

On the one hand, it is undeniable that advertising has a lot of upsides. Firstly, advertising is of benefit to help products sell quickly and increase profits for the company. For example, Bao Vina, which specializes in TV production in Binh Duong, has increased advertising for new products via the Internet platform after the Covid-19 pandemic, contributing to a quick economic recovery with a large profit return the money lost when inactive for a long time. Secondly, advertising promotes competition among goods, leading to growing product quality. Take Pepsi and Coca-Cola as an example. They are extremely famous drinking water companies in Vietnam and always compete with each other. Therefore, they are always creative and increasingly product quality is shown through advertisements to want to attract more customers than rival companies.

On the other hand, advertising on social networks also brings people unwanted effects. Firstly, social media advertisements find it very easy to manipulate buyers into unnecessary items and this is waste of money. Take my aunt as an example. She tends to know how to balance the expenses for the family. However, last month, when she saw an advertisement for a pair of shoes on TV, she could not control her actions and ordered it immediately even though she knew it was unnecessary. Therefore, it cost her all the living expenses of this month.

Some people think movies should only be for entertainment. Others think that they should also have educational values.,"Some would argue films simply is a source of entertainment, while others believe that it should be also included educational aspects. While movies and series can merely for fun and pleasure, but I believe that it would be better to involve educational goals.

On the one hand, nobody can deny that watching a movie is great entertainment. Almost every household owns one or more televisions, and everybody loves to watch a certain television program or type of film. After a long day at work or school, many people want to come home and sit in front of the TV to relax and pleasure. This is the perfect way to take their mind off the stress of daily life and have enjoyment with their families. For instance, in my own country, most people go to the cinema for watching new movies at the weekend to enjoy their time with each other. However, I think that watching movies as entertainment is merely a small aspect of the role of films within society in comparison with education.

On the other hand, films and TV programs can have very strong effects on the minds of audiences. This is a great way by using this impact to educate people and children. Most of the sociologists assume that the majority of social problems can be shown as movies to learn people regarding the functions of that within their life and societies. Children can also learn about right and wrong through the cartoons they watch, while adults can learn many important lessons through watching films. For example, watching a film about war cause people to have a strong sense of patriotism for their country which could be seen as a positive educational effect.

In conclusion, It is true some think that movie is just a leisure activity, but I believe that movies have more beneficial by using the educational goal and help to solve the social problems. ",No,Yes,6.5

Although video games have some positive sides, I personally believe that they have more negative effects on our minds, and the following essay will discuss them in details.

For a number of reasons, a lot of people believe that video games are entertaining and educative. It is believed that video games could help people in releasing their stress. Players could feel the excitement of being a heroic character or a professional athlete, without having the risk of being injured or hurt. And then, there are some video games which are considered as educative as well, as they are created to trigger people's imaginative thinking, such as Tetris or chess.

Secondly, some games have shown violence and sadistic scenes and affected to the gamers' mind. There have been several cases in America, whereas students have done violence acts to their classmates because they were influenced by the game. And lastly, video games have affected to residents' health condition as well. People who play video games have the tendency to consume light snacks and do less exercise. Consequently, they have a risk of getting obesity and diabetic problems.

This transition from outdoor activities to indoor video games has many pros and cons depending on how this is being used. While physical activities help build health, video games are helping in changing our technology in various ways.

Firstly, playing computer games helps in developing insticts to understand and fight difficult situatuions successfully.

Moreover, there are many games that assist parents in teaching their children subjects like mathematics, science and history. While, it is easier for parents, it has also improved the level of the knowledge of children. A great example to explain this, is the use of Math genius a video game in my school to help students learn mathematics in an innovative way.

As for as disadvantages are concerned, one of the major issues is effect on the physical health of the children who like playing video games. Without any exercise, these games are damaging healthy life style, growth and mental well being of those children. For example, a study conducted in 1983 in Australia, shows that the hospital visits of the children who play more video games were higher than those who play some kind of outdoor sports. The other drawback that is related to video games is that it reduces social life of a person. By playing in the room on a laptop or a computer, one never finds an opportunity to interact and make friends.

One perennial disadvantage of video games since ages is that it directly affects the eyes of the children. we have seen that the eye sight of the children get weak if they play video games for large amount of time. Also, it is seen these days that there are many video games have come in the market which increases the anxiety and stress disorders in the children. The children get so engages in these video games that they are loosing interest in the social activities and outdoor games.

In conclusion, there are both advantages and disadvantages of playing the video games. Off course, anything if consumed in excess can turn out to be curse. so the parents can play a paramount role by wisely limiting the engagement of their children in video games and engaging them the outdoor games and activities as well thus maintaining a balance betwe",No,Yes,6.5
"Some people believe that allowing children to make their own decisions on daily matters such as food, clothing and entertainment is likely to result in a society of individuals who only think about their own wishes. Others believe that it is important for children to make decisions about things that affect them. Discuss both of these views and give your own opinion.","Some individuals argue that encouraging children to decide daily issues such as feeding, clothing and fun independently could lead to a world of selfish individuals whereas others claim that children should be allowed to choose their personal wishes. In my opinion, the age of a child should be considered before empowering them or discouraging them from making daily choices.

On the one hand, children who make personal choices could become self-centered. What this means is that when a child learns early to choose between a variety of meals, attires and relaxation activities, they might seek only their own interest and neglect the feelings of others. For example, an eleven-year-old boy who is allowed to eat a double ration of food than he normally should have would be reducing the food quantity of other people in his home.

On the other hand, children who make decisions concerning daily activities learn independence. This therefore implies that a young child who is granted permission to accept or refuse specific meals, outfits and fun engagements will develop the ability to think on their own. To illustrate this, teenagers whose parents support them in terms of personal shipping and leisure are known to make sounds decisions which are applaudable.

In my opinion, the age of children affects their decision making. Younger children should be guided by adults or their parents while teenagers can be permitted to choose whatever they want. For instance, babies need their parents to choose their food but teenagers do not necessarily need to be told that excess sugar or fat is harmful.

In conclusion, although certain individuals defend independent decision making for children and some other persons claim that this could lead to self-centeredness, I firmly believe that children's age should not be overlooked in such matters. ",No,Yes,6.5
Children today are too dependent on computers and electronic entertainment. It would be better for them to be outside playing sports and taking part in more traditional pastimes than spending all day indoors. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Most children are glued to their computer or cellphone these days. This is not a positive development because when children spend the whole day playing games on their computer or gaming console, they will develop many health problems. They may even develop behavioural problems. In my opinion, it is more beneficial for children to spend time outdoors playing sports or engaging in other activities.

Outdoor games are good for children. They make them fitter and stronger as individuals. Children who play games are healthier. They are also less likely to engage in antisocial activities. Better still, outdoor games require the participation of more than one individual. When children play games like football or cricket, they are also learning several social and management skills. They learn to share and work as part of a team.

On the other hand, children who spend the whole time indoors will most probably spend several hours in front of the TV or computer. This may lead to several health problems like obesity and diabetes. These children may also find it difficult to interact with others. Also, when they spend a lot of time on their computer, they are more likely to be exposed to inappropriate materials on the internet. All of these factors can have an adverse impact on their physical and psychological well-being.

To conclude, it is not hard to see that there are several benefits to engaging in outdoor activities. Parents should not allow children to waste their whole time in front of the TV or computer. Even in those families where both parents are away at work, parents can use software programs to limit their children’s exposure to television and the internet. ",No,Yes,6.5
Some people believe that violence shown today on entertainment media is the cause of criminal activity in the society. Is this true? What can be done to address this issue?,"A group of people have the opinion that, the reason for increasing crimes in today's society is the violence seen on the entertainment channel. It is true to some extend and there are several ways to resolve this issue.

First of all, it is true that, nowadays, the crime rate is increased due to the violence seen in the entertainment field. The main cause of this is the youngsters have the tendency to imitate what they saw in the films and other media. It is because they consider the heroes and heroines as role models and try to follow the things they are shown in media. Teenagers think that whatever shown in the media is right and might misunderstand it as original life. They have a huge curiosity and tendency to imitate the criminal activities shown in entertainment media and become criminals and might ruin their entire life.

The best way to solve this issue is to give awareness to young people in society. This can be done by parents, teachers, and government authorities. Convince them that orginal life is entirely different from entertainment life. For that, the media can telecast interviews of famous personalities themselves to give awareness to the society that this is only for getting fame and money and not to copy it in people's life. Counseling given in school is another way to reduce the imitating tendency of youngsters. This may help in reducing crime rates.

To conclude, brutality shown in entertainment shows is one of the reasons for increasing crimes. To solve this issue young people in society need to reduce their following tendency otherwise it will negatively affect people's life as well as society. ",No,Yes,6.5
Some people say that young people today do not make good use of their leisure time and that they spend too much time inside watching television and playing video games and that they should rather spend more time outside engaging in physical activities.To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is argued that youngsters spend loads of leisure time playing computer games or watching TV programs instead of involving outside activities. From my point of view young people should spend their free time more beneficially and should use it for their advantage.

Nowadays the game industry is the most popular activity among people due to a wide range of types of games. Playing computer games has several negative effects on their health issues like obesity, stress, depression or sleeping disorders. During this activity people have a lack of physical activities that leads to the overweight. Besides, the risen emotions after stressful games can impact on the dreams of slumbers or get anxiety during sleeping.

Being a couch potato is an accustomed sedentary lifestyle among individuals that leads to being isolated from the world. Also, these people can’t be up to date with the latest news or may be so shy with other people, as the result they may lose conversational skills and fail their career prospects, because engaging with new people or visiting different conferences give an essential experience for their successful life. In this year the number of viewers has increased to 46% compared to the past.

In your opinion, do the drawbacks of video games outweigh the benefits?","These days, more and more children are playing computer games. While some people believe that this activity is the cause of some problems, others argue that it has a variety of benefits, such as education. From my perspective, there are more advantages than drawbacks, as I will outline below.

There are a number of advantages of playing computer games. One of the most obvious of these is that computer games are a cheap and safe way for people to relax. For example, gamer can join in an online game from the comfort of their own home, and do not need to go out and spend money in malls or bars to relax. Another reason why video games are beneficial is because they can be educational. In particular, gamer can learn a lot of computer skills.

However, there are some drawbacks to playing video games. Firstly, it is not uncommon for people to become addicted to the virtual world. The result of this is that they may not have a healthy diet, sleep enough or do enough exercise. Secondly, people who play video games regularly may neglect their studies or jobs because they are more interested in the game than their real-life responsibilities.

Ultimately, as with many topics, there are both positives and negatives. Although there are some drawbacks of video games, I believe that there are more advantages for society.

Video games are known to have positive and negative impacts on children. This essay will highlight these impacts in detail.

To being with, addiction to video games is a real phenomenon and can affect children adversely. Playing video games all day long can influence a child’s health, such as; it can weaken one’s eyesight. Similarly, with the popularity of video games amongst the children, they no longer prefer to participate in outdoor activities, which affects their physical capabilities.

"In many countries around the world, shopping has turned into a form of entertainment rather than a way of getting what people need. Discuss the reason for this trend. Is it a positive or negative development?","In an earlier time, people used to do shopping to fulfill necessitates but nowadays e-commerce has tremendously accelerated the shopping trend worldwide. Hence, some people reckon that in the modern era shopping is the one best method to enjoy lives on, the contrary, others opine that it is a way to acquire some necessary things. In my point of view, it is a negative development in which later people may see bad repercussion after spending money on unnecessary things.

To embark upon, there is no iota of doubt that people are bombarded with advertisements. To elaborate it further, many shopkeepers give vibrant ads about their products for example on television, radio, hoardings and pamphlets which may persuade individuals to buy irrelevant things even they do not need. Additionally, some ads are performed by celebrities, and they not only have a profound influence on the young generation but also cynosure are role models for youth. The adolescents follow their role models without thinking anything as they started to imitate their mentor lifestyles such as what celebs wear in clothing, accessories and shoes. A closer analysis is done at the University of Cambridge reveals that 80% of humans buy excessive things after influencing by prominent people in India.

Moreover, the earning of families have increased and subsequently, there is a rise in their purchasing power. Apart from this, an introduction of credit cards and loan repayment plans are providing more money to people for shopping. Owing to this, families are indulged themselves to purchase things that are not essential for them.

Nevertheless, I believe that this trend negative for multifarious reasons. There are innumerable moments in the lives of people where they need money for important situations. Spending lavishly on useless things may lead individuals to suffer from oppression. Furthermore, piling up commodities in the house is worthless and throwing away old goods is the sheer wastage of money as well as resources. Although, humans should value things which they only hold and dispose of them that they are either broken or useless.

After discussing all of the aforementioned ideas, it can be reiterated that people should save money for some unforeseen circumstances which may happen at any time in their lives. Shopping is an inevitable part of our life therefore, we should buy things wisely.",No,No,6.5
some people believe that party is good for entertainment while some think it's a wastage of money and time.discuss both views and give your own opinions.,"Entertainment is part and parcel of our life. It is a widely accepted belief that partying with family and friends is quite essential for making our life joyful. However, some masses argue that it is a wastage of vital resources like time and money. This essay will elucidate both the opinions and further would substantiate my own opinion in the concluding paragraph below. At the outset, there are several factors which prove that parties are profound to fill our life with entertainment. Firstly, it is one of the best source to meet with our friends and families and spend fantastic time with them together. This point can be justified with the help of an example. 70 percent of the people in India are long lived as they meet their near and dear ones occasionally and are cheerful. Secondly, parties also provide a path to follow our passion for sometime and relaxes our mind. If I may present it in terms of statistics, 40 percent of the people in US dance to their favourite dance numbers when they are out for some get together. On the contrary, there are several considerations as well which signifies that parties are a complete means of draining our money and time. Primarily, affording a lavish party is not economical which results the youth spending large amount of their savings. This money could otherwise be utilised in some vital causes like charities, education and paying heavy college fees. For instance, 60 percent of the youth in US are college dropouts as they can't afford to pay the University fees. Secondarily, the time spent on parties is not less than 4-5 hours which may vary from person to person. This time is not utilised adequately as the outcome of these occasions is null. To recapitulate, parties are essential for the change in our lives. In my opinion, they are not as profound as they drain away our hard earned money just in a flick of time. We should not bolster their growth in future. ",No,Yes,6.5
entertainment industry professionals are paid very high. do you agree or disagree with this development.,"It is a common notion that Persons involved in professional sports and entertainment industry get paid really well nowadays. It shows that people want to get entertained even if they have to pay for it. I completely agree with the notion and the reasons for the same will be scrutinized in this essay.

To embark on, with the advent of modernization, working cultures have become more hectic, which has caused the increase in stress among working class. Therefore, individuals always look for the ways to cope up with that mental as well as physical tiredness and sports along with cinema provides a great opportunity to tackle this issue. So, even if they are provided with an opportunity to get entertained even after paying some money, there is no hesitation among them into doing so. Hence, the demand of quality entertainment sources has risen significantly. Because of that, when some investor invests money in these sectors, he often gets a good return. So, the individuals, who are good in these professions get paid really well.

Moreover, the dependence on these ways of entertainment has become more due to the arrival of modern technology. Earlier, there were not many means for entertaining self like televisions and mobiles. So, people were more involved with their families in their leisure time. Instead of watching someone else play, they themselves used to engage in these activities. Talking about film industry, actors were not paid reasonably well because of the reason that there were very less theatres and televisions at houses. So, they could not recover their investment in movies. For instance, the number of tickets being sold in olden times were comparatively less than the numbers being sold today.

To recapitulate, sports and entertainment industry has grown a lot due to the high demand of entertainment as people are working on hectic working hours in stressful environments as well as they have plenty of options available in the form of modern gadgets. ",No,Yes,6.5

Famous people working in the entertainment industry such as movie stars and sports figures are often paid millions of dollars in one single year. Many people think this is unfair while poverty is still a big problem. Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"It is a concerning fact that these days the individuals who work in entertainment are paid a huge salary. From my perspective, I partly assent to this point of view. Therefore, this essay will discuss the causes leading to this reality and explain why celebrities deserve to have a substantial income before coming to a reasonable conclusion.

To begin with, there are many understandable reasons why many entertainers such as movie stars, singers, and sports figures get a great deal of money. The primary reason is that the growing popularity of entertainment plays a pivotal role in the development of a country. For example, through movies, music videos, . . the entertainers bring an enormous motivation and inspiration to residents which help them relieve the stress after their hard-working day. In addition, the evolution of the entertainment industry brings a huge contribution to the improvement of a country’s reputation, which promotes this country’s image to the world. The celebrities who represent their country participate in the world's competitions which puts this country's entertainment industry on the world’s map. Furthermore, the main resource of the national budget is from the figure of the public who contribute the major portion to the country's total such as tax, entertainers’ income tax, . . . that help the quality of citizens’ life keeps improving. Another reason is that the celeb’s income not only reflects their amount of working time but also makes them practice as much as possible to maintain the positive professional images and their quality’s product keeps becoming better. For instance, individuals working in the entertainment industry have a busy working schedule until midnight while normal workers have a nine-to-five job. Therefore, there is no doubt that figures of the public should be paid a higher salary than other occupations.

On the other hand, it is claimed that the big names should have the as same as salary other people in other jobs. The major reason is that the high level of income disparities will pose a serious threat to the balance of the country's economy which is a leading contributor to the gap between the rich and people who have a meager income. As a result, people working in different employment will feel dissatisfied with their salaries that would lead to tensions and conflicts. Thus, demonstrations are happening in some parts of the world in order to achieve a fair income

In conclusion, famous people’s attractive salary is beneficial to some extent. However, in my point of view, I am inclined that every individual should have a fair income",No,No,6
Some people think that professional workers should be paid more than sports and entertainment personalities. To what extent do you agree?,"It is widely believed that employees having specific expertise should be given a higher salary compared to athletes and artists. I tend to have different point of view regarding this case after considering work load, risks and outcome in all sectors.

To begin with, It is undeniable both entertainments and sports workers should give their best performance to attain their success. They should take a risk and invest in their future for accomplishing their goals in these paths. Thus, obtaining a higher salary compared to workers in another sectors would be highly reasonable. Another consideration is their contribution to the country. By being famous and obtaining achievements in their sectors, athletes and artists would stand in the high stage and give a pride to their nation. National flag and anthem of some countries, for example, would be shown if they obtain the highest rank in certain tournament.

I do appreciate some people saying that professional workers should be paid more as they have contributed to the country in the top priority sectors. However, never do I think that their salary should be higher than the others. Even though it is essential, I believe that everyone has worked in their proportion as their contribution.

In conclusion, even though people who work in entertainment and sport sectors seem to have easy tasks than individuals who play a role as a professional in a special field, I believe that professional worker should not be paid more than the athletes and artists since they have equal work load and risks in their jobs.

This development has both benefits and drawbacks but i think the positive aspect ellipses the negative aspect.

It can be said that the habitat changes has some worthy disadvantages. Firstly, it brings the nature away from creatures. All the ocean animals need their habitat because it has all the necessary item for them to survive.

While the manmade habitat can not response enough for animals'demand. Secondly, this development affects the ocean species loss their natural instinct. a creature can not keep its own instinct which mean, it's not animal anymore, instead of that, it become more simmilar to the pet. And when it turn back to the ocean, animal not be able to survive in the forthcoming.

Despite the aforementioned drawbacks, several benefits do exist and should be take into consideration. Within the population of ocean enviromental, live in the aquarium is better. In amusement park, the enviroment index always reach the quality average. And it also provides enough food for creatures live the healthy life. Secondly, ocean creatures can be protected by human. In the wild habitat outside, there are great number of illegal fishing activity, and it make the amount of ocean creatures decline dramatically. Keeping the speices in the aquarium can help animals risist from decreation of population and also gain the awareness for people who watching them.

I believe that the habitat changes for ocean creatures bring both plus points and minus points, but the strength outweighs the weakness because the development of technology nowaday, human is trying to create the enviroment very similar to the natural habitat outside for preserving the indanger animals both on land or under water.

However, others believe that the entertainment for adult should also receive financial support from the states. This essay will discuss both view before presenting my personal stand on this topic.

From one side, many people claim that the importance of education must be recognised by the government. First, it is undeniable that education is the key to the development of any country. Policy markets generally agree that investing in early education has the highest returns. Failing to provide the citizens with all the opportunities shool can have knock-on impacts that follow than through their whole life. It is a fact that an individual without any post-school qualifications is 20 percent less likely to be in a job, and twice as likely to be unemployed as someone with it.

Second, education is a fundamental right for everyone. It remains one of the most important duties of any government and it is a public responsibility to provide access to high quality education for everyone. As the standard of education is improved, this lead to improvements in other areas including science, technology, health care. Therefore, public invesment to ensure a good educational in frastructure for lifelong learning is necessary.

From the other side, some people assert that a greater emphasis should be put on funding for in recreational activities for young people. The first reson is that entertainment plays a crucial role in a person’s mental health. More specifically, certain forms of entertainment such as painting, making cake, playing chess help us to relieve stress, regain energy and divert our mind from day-to-day worries. Entertaining activities is essential in this era when there has been a considerable growth in the number of people suffering from stress due to their work and study.

In addition, the entertainment industry creates jobs for millions of people, and also contributes to the national budget. It is critical to realize that actists, actors, dancers, composers ect are doing their part to drive the economy forward. Therefore, the states should have adequate investment in this sector.

In conclusion, there are mixed opinions on this topic, but I am more likely to agree with the idea that a smarter population can help to build up a powerful nation. Education should always remain the top priority of any country and investment in entertainment should be a secondary task if resources allow. ",No,Yes,6.5

For instance, DSTV in 2019 cited that the number one most watched channel on television is Cartoon network and also cited that this channel is alway active during the day when children are at home.

However, some people still hold a different view point saying the television is also a modern method of learning. They believe there are educational channels and programs that are helpful in acquiring general knowledge. For instance, The National Geographic channel broadcasts information of land features, how the ecosystem balances itself and also the effects of climate change on various types of environments.

To conclude, the television is used mostly for entertainment as most children watch cartoons after school while some others still argue the television is useful for learning as well. It can ne said that the number one use of the television is to entertain as most people tend to watch movies most often on the television. ",No,Yes,6.5
Nowadays it is possible to relocate marine animals to entertainment parks,"Nowadays, a large number of the sea creatures are moved from their natural habitats to the entertainment parks as sea life centres and ocean parks, which has a great impact on the lives of the creatures. From my point of view, the demerits are outweighing the merits and the reasons for my inclination are articulated in the ensuing paragraphs.

To commence with, On the one hand, there is a plethora of disadvantages to move the animals in the ocean parks. First and for most, in their early age, they are separated from their family and mother to train them better to earn more money by giving thrilling performances, which will create a huge impact on their growth and in the long run has become a reason for longevity reduction. For example, Dolphin's average age is 20 years in natural habitats; while they live only average 12 years in the amusement parks. Secondly, they have very less space to enjoy their activity, they feel monotonous by living in a closed area, which affects their mental health. Lastly, sometimes the new environment means the ocean parks are not suitable for their nature and soul, that they might end up their lives at a very early stage, which becomes the reason for unbalancing the food chain.

On the other hand, by placing the creatures in the entertainment parks boosts the economy of the country by providing knowledge and entertainment for the children. Moreover, many times the main reason for the transfer is the scientific research to flourish their life by providing them the required nutritions and medicines to combat from chronic disease such as cancer. For instance, the Asiatic lions are under the scientific study because of they are about to extinct, and trials are going on to protect them and increase their population.

In conclusion, however, there are certain advantages to move sea creatures from their natural habitats by feeding them sufficient nutritions and medicines; the disadvantages are many as it decreases their longevity and which greatly impact on the balance of the food chain and ecosystem.

Are Talent TV shows the good way to find talent or just for entertainment?,"The rise of the entertainment industry is becoming more and more intriguing to audiences due to the diversity of TV shows, and looking-for-talent topics get the most attention. Whether these ideas TV shows is only about profit or an effective way to truly find talented people are still in discussion; I support the first idea which is that talent TV shows helps a lot on seeking gifted individuals.

It is undinable that most TV shows is surviving by getting the interest from the audiances. This means that not only designing a show appeared on TV depending on the quality of the judges but also how diversity of the participants or the story behide all of them such as the fascinating background of the candidates, for example, how many obsticles they have overcome to achieve that level. American got talent proved themselves as a annual high budget TV shows due to the wide range performance of the participants. If it the performances it were extroardinary, they would rapidly increase the reputation of the shows; however; if they were a disaster, they also created relax and funny moments for everyone.

Besides the high profit, I still support that those televised talent shows are worth invested to truly explore individuals’s potential. Taking One Direction band for instance, participating in X-Factor gave them a highly regconition from the judges and audience due to their great ability to sing. Even though the band was collapsed, each of the members still have their own career path and have their own hit songs. Moreover, considering the most successful talent shows in the world reveal that the judges are extremly important to optimize the chance to find the truly talented individuals. Gordan Ramsey from Master Chef or Simon Cowell from X Factor are known as the best in the world at their specialty. In my opinion, other talented shows could learn the recipe of the sucessful pioneers to help them not only achieving the core target fiding talent, but also being a billion-dollar industry.

In conclusion, televisions bring a lot of benefit to expose talented individuals to other people, but being a show means being entertaining, both ideas cannot be seperated. Balancing between making profit and the core value will bring a huge success for this industry. ",No,Yes,6.5

Games which are hazardous and dangerous can effect on the caracter of the chidren. In this essay I will give some sentiments why the authority shoud impose a ban to halt them. On the one hand, there are several factors to stop detrimental games. Firstly, children who play or watch games including cybercrime they are in spirit of evil. In this game children learn a number of violence. Take for example, one can not arise interest concerning anything. This game is always to be in her or his mind. They do not tend to study due to playing such kind of games regularly. On the other hand, it is observed a considerable amount of solutions to sort out this issue.

JBL Quantum 600 Wireless Over-Ear Performance Gaming Headset with Surround Sound and Game-Chat Balance Dial - Black,"It is clear that numerous old people are being taken care by care homes or nursing homes. Although they all have families still they are being cared by the home. In this essay, I will explore the benefits and drawbacks of this direction.

To begin with, on the positives, aged people will have more time to spend for themselves. With being in family, they might have to look after their grand children and sometimes may have to sacrifice what they feel to do. For instance, if they feel tired and try to get some sleep, and during that time if their grand children seek for any support, they might have to forget about they wish for. Besides having ample of time, they can lead a family stress free life when they are alone. Since, they will not be in seeing the problematic or issue situations which family is going through. To illustrate this point, if the family members are facing challenge because of money or health or work related problems, with aged person staying away from family will help them free from these stress.

Nevertheless, these people do have drawbacks of being in care homes. Firstly, they will not have anyone to share their love or talk about old days as they are not being surrounded by their family community. Though they have other aged people like them, some people will still like to share with their own members. For example, if they want to talk about their marriage anniversary (which would have happened long ago) there won’t be anyone hearing them. Lastly, they will have a dull last life and this is due to the fact that being lonely. To give an example, many people will think only of the days they spent delighted and they will obviously miss those days. Hence, this makes them feel worried and each day will be sad.

In conclusion, although they have a plethora of time and free from family stress, some still have loneliness and dull life. ",No,No,6.5
SHOWS A GGOD METHOD OF FINDING TALENT PEOPLE OR ARE THEY JUST ENTERTAINMENT,"People have talent inside them; some people realize they have it, but others don’t realize it. Now we can see many broadcast about talent contest on television, in my view today, the contest not only showing their talent but their entertaining too.

We know the talent shows are the biggest event when people show their talent like singing, dancing, cooking, and other from the usual to the extreme talent they can do it. If we watch the old talent shows, we can see the difference from then and now. For example, master chef season old and now their skill to cook is not a problem, but I think now their make it little more drama in there for entertain.

In the other hand, talent contest is not only for shows people talent but they also entertain and make audience or viewers happy with their performance. When someone win the contest, the winner can get money in a huge amount. Singing is a one of talent people show and easy way can make people become fast to be famous. However, many singer or artist can famous without follow the talent contest. They pure famous with their potential like songs they created or they can attract attention from anybody.

Is playing video games addictive? Is there a point where these games become dangerous?,"Computer games have been considered to be one of the most popular entertainment activities that people do in their spare time. It seems to remove all the stress we have in a period and has positive impacts on the player. But it's also easy to get addicted to games and can push you over the edge.

In my opinion, the reason why people become obsessed with games is that they like the thrill in the game, it could be in fighting games, shooting games, . . . The excitement can get more intense from low to high levels. Or from what I saw, some of my friends get addicted to games causes they want to compete with friends, want to show off their ""skills"" to get respect from others. On the other hand, some like games that much because it helps them create the virtual world that they dream to live in real life.

Moreover, being addicted to video games is like using addictive drugs. Playing games from time to time can be harmful to your health caused by lack of sleep, short-sighted by hours of watching the LED screen, obesity because of no exercise, . . . or reduce the productivity of your life. Many children spend the majority of their time playing computer games and hardly engage in school work and less communicate with relatives.

Advantages and disadvantages of using of video games and computers,"Today, a number of human beings are using computers, even if a great deal of school children and teenagers keen on computer games. in fact in the situation has a lot of advantages and disadvantages too. In the essey, I want to explain the problem widely.

Firstly, there are beneficial using internet or computer, because they can make easy any kinds of different works belong to technology.

Especially, our documents and on-line teaching are being developed by using Internet and computers. Our the minds of our children are being increased in the way. they can use any problems if they come across, they have abilities in using of the different versions of computers.

Secondly, video games and computers are entered in our teenagers. They are not bored with them. Children spend their leisure time by using video games.

What are the advantages and disadvantages of video games?","Nowadays, mushrooming of video games is becoming very prominent in youth. The excess use of video games can drastically affect. Whereas, it can be beneficial in alot of aspects. Some merits and demerits of video games are stated below.

The increasing interest of youth in video games, has a terrible corns. Firstly, it affects the health of young bloods. Video game playing results in weakening of eyesight and other related problems, it makes us lazy, as we can easily excess digitally and need very less physical efforts.

Violence in TV Shows and Video games,"Do you believe that violence in television and video games affects our society? If you do, then many people are on your side, however, I do not concur with that since many factors aren't being considered when making this decision. These factors can include that violence in video games can help release stress, violence in TV shows or video games can help bring creativity to a child, and that many other things can lead to hostile behavior a child can gain. In this essay, you will find out why I believe that violence on TV or video games isn't that bad.

To begin with, let's talk about the first reason I stated, violence in video games can help release stress. Although violence in video games can be seen as inflicting hostile behavior to the minds of children, it is a wrong way to see it, it is best to always look at the positives when evaluating something, which is something most of us don’t do. Stress in children is a serious issue that needs to be solved and in my opinion violence in video games can help with that. Video games like Fortnite, Valorant, Call of Duty, and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive are all pretty well-known for having violence in them, and I have tried one of them previously and it helped me release lots of stress that comes with school, whether it is in the form of homework, tests, projects, or grades in general.

Another reason I believe that violence in video games and television isn’t necessarily a bad thing is that it can induce creativity in a child. Creativity isn’t an easy trait to gain, it can come in many ways whether it comes from surroundings or situations it depends, but having creativity is important for the development of a child. Video games and TV shows that have violence usually have amazing graphics that you would want to stare at all day just observing little details. These graphics are in such games to grab the attention of people all around the world, so they can gain popularity for the amazing graphics. An example of a game with amazing graphics is valorant, if you just go into a custom game and just observe the map and the textures in it, it can be pretty mind boggling.

The last reason I mentioned, was that many other factors induce hostile behavior in children, then violent video games and TV shows. These factors can include physical and mental abuse inflicted by loved ones or even strangers, that may lead to hostile behavior towards others; to release the anger they have built up because of the abuser. In many cases of abuse, the abuser doesn’t realize the effect they have on the abusee, and how much anger and resentment they may hold against them. This anger and resentment can induce hostile behavior towards others hugely. Usually, when people see someone with hostile behavior that plays violent games or watches violent TV shows, they immediately relate their hostility on the video games and TV shows they play/watch. This method of thinking has made many people blame video games and TV shows instead of trying to dig deeper into a serious topic that may lead to tragedy.

In conclusion, I believe that violence in video games and TV shows aren't what’s making our society rotten, because it can release stress, induce creativity, and there may be other factors that induce hostility more than violence in video games. Physical or mental violence is never \ the answer to release anger and stress but watching and playing violent games can help in releasing anger and stress, but be careful that when associated with this kind of media to take safety precautions like turning off chat for any bad things said by other players and not talking bad about players in chat or voice.

"Scientists predict in the near future cars will be driven by computers, not people. Why? Do you think it is a positive or negative development?","In the upcoming years, cars and other vehicles are projected to be driven automatically by computers. From my perspective, this phenomenon brings more advantages than disadvantages.In short, growing level of automation in this modern era is inevitable. More specifically, the emergence of self-driving technology is around the corner and despite initial concerns, this should be perceived as a positive trend. 

First, there are several driving forces behind this forecast. Steadily increasing budget from the government and giant corporations has brought about groundbreaking advances in robotics technology. The last few decades have witnessed robots gradually takes over manufacturing jobs previously done by human. Soon enough, automation will become a ubiquitous presence in our daily life, handling a variety of tasks including driving. In addition, given that traffic accidents are on the rise, especially in densely populated cities, self-driving cars could be the answer to reduce fatalities. Simply by taking human emotions and errors out of the equation, autopilot mode could indeed save millions of lives from car crash incidence.

Having said that, the benefits of autonomous cars certainly outweigh the drawbacks. Operated with a high degree of precision, self-driving vehicles can greatly reduce average commuter times in metropolitan areas, offering many spin-off advantages from well-being to boosting the economy. Besides, with driverless cars able to access up-to-the-minute data to help monitor traffic, as well as digital maps and other tools, they could determine the fastest, most efficient route possible. All of this will result in less congestion, less time-consuming and fuel waste.",No,Yes,6.5
"it is said that the fast pace of our everyday life, as a direct result of the rapid development of telecommunications technology and the travel industry, has negative effects on individuals, nations, globe.","In recent decades, according to a number of people, the swift rate of progress of some high-tech in communication and commutation which have been imprinting on our daily life has negatively made an impression on people, nations, and world. I tend to disagree with this argument, nevertheless, I believe that by the benefits of this development, its drawbacks cannot be ignored and in this essay, I will discuss both sides of the topic.

On one hand, thanks to the developing technology, people around the world are able to connect with each other remotely in seconds. Indeed, this fast connection along with improving the transportation system has assisted to boost international trade, growth of the global economy, and in summary, led to the development of more and more nations in all fields. To illustrate this, in the past, businessmen for marketing the local goods internationally, irrespective of wasting huge time and energy, rarely received all markets. While today not only does all commerce access whole world markets but also transactions are done quickly and without any requirement for traveling.

On the other hand, it should be taken into consideration the negative side of this progress. Simply put, telecommunications has been gradually eliminating face-to-face relationships and converting individuals into an isolated person. According to psychological researchers, this is more likely to damage society due to the fact of the increasing criminal aspects of this manner of life. Also, in terms of the travel industry, it is obvious that through this boom accelerating the destruction of the environment and annoying traffic congestion are tangible.

Overall, although it seems these developments are hard on societies, advantages them are noticeable and have been serving mankind noticeably. ",No,Yes,6.5
"The government cannot fund all research projects because its budget is limited; therefore, some people insist that only research pertaining to the field of science and technology should receive government funding.","The government cannot fund all research projects because its budget is limited; therefore, some people insist that only research pertaining to the field of science and technology should receive government funding. While I do admit that scientific research should receive maximum funding, I totally disagree with the argument that the government should stop funding research in less ‘useful’ fields like arts or history.

Scientific research certainly provides tremendous value because scientific innovations have the power to change our lives for good. Take, for instance, the invention of the antibiotic. This wonder drug saved the lives of millions of people and continues to be a major lifesaver even today. The computer is also the result of scientific research. This invention changed the way we work and store information. Today, it is impossible to imagine a world without computers. Other inventions like electricity, motor vehicles and home appliances have also revolutionized our lives.

However, just because scientific research provides more value it does not mean that research in other ‘less useful’ fields should be discouraged. Of course, archeological research or research into the origin of languages is unlikely to have a massive impact on our day-to-day life. Yet, this information is crucial for understanding how we reached where we are today. The truth is that there are still a lot of things we can learn from previous generations. These kinds of research may even lead us to a common ancestor and that might put an end to the hostility prevailing between many nations. Historical research also teaches us about mistakes we must not repeat. The World Wars and the Genocide are two examples. Research on these horrific incidents keeps reminding us about the extent of damage they caused. If future generations do not learn about them, they might be tempted to commit the same mistakes again.

To conclude, not only scientific research but research in other fields also provides great value. Therefore, the argument that only scientific research should receive government funding does not hold water. ",No,Yes,6.5
Some people believe that technology has made man more social. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"Experts throughout both the developing and developed world have debated whether the advent of sophisticated modern technology such as mobile phones, laptops and iPad have helped to enhance and improve people’s social lives or whether the opposite has become the case. Personally, I strongly advocate the former view. This essay will discuss both sides using examples from the UK government and Oxford University to demonstrate points and prove arguments.

On the one hand there is ample, powerful, almost daily evidence that such technology can be detrimental especially to the younger generation who are more easily affected by it’s addictive nature and which can result in people feeling more isolated from the society. The central reason behind this is twofold, firstly, the invention of online social media sites and apps, such as Twitter and Facebook have reduced crucial face-to-face interactions dramatically. Through use of these appealing and attractive mediums, people feel in touch and connected yet lack key social skills and the ability to communicate. Secondly, dependence on such devices is built up frighteningly easily which may have a damaging effect on mental health and encourage a sedentary lifestyle. For example, recent scientific research by the UK government demonstrated that 90% of people in their 30s spend over 20 hours per week on Messenger and similar applications to chat with their friends instead of meeting up and spending quality time together or doing sport. As a result, it is conclusively clear that these technology advancements have decreased and diminished our real life interactions.

On the other hand, although there are significant downsides to technological developments, its’ multifold advantages cannot be denied. This is largely because the popularity of technology such as cellphones allows people to connect freely and easily with no geographical barriers. People are able to share any type of news, information, photos and opinions with their loved ones whenever and wherever they want therefore keeping a feeling of proximity and closeness. For example, an extensive study by Oxford University illustrated that people who work, or study abroad and use applications like Facetime and WhatsApp to chat with their families, are less likely to experience loneliness and feel out of the loop than those who do not. Consistent with this line of thinking is that businessmen are also undoubtedly able to benefit from these advances by holding virtual real -time meetings using Skype which may increase the chance of closing business deals without the need to fly.

From the arguments and examples given I firmly believe that overall communication and mans’ sociability has been advanced enormously due to huge the huge technological progress of the past twenty years and despite some potentially serious health implications which governments should not fail to address, it is predicted that its popularity will continue to flourish in the future.

"The presence of technology in the classroom has become more and more apparent and offers students tremendous resources with which to supplement their education. Given time, technology will completely replace the traditional teacher in the classroom. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?","Technology has been increasingly used throughout the world. This is very apparent in classrooms today. It is disagreed that technology will replace teachers in the classroom. This will be proven by analysing how teachers can cater to the needs of their students as well as motivate and discipline them.

A very important aspect of teaching is the ability of the teacher to shape their teaching style to the needs of their students, as an example, if students in any given class are having trouble understanding a classroom topic, the teacher can rephrase the topic and deliver it in a more effective way, a computerized teacher would be less in-tune with what students require and thus would be incapable of doing this, as a result, technology will not replace teachers.

Motivation and discipline are key to a student`s academic success in the classroom. This is very apparent when teaching children as children require more motivation and discipline to be taught effectively, a technology-based teacher simply cannot accomplish this as certain situations require judgement as to whether a student is acting in an inappropriate manner. After analysing this, it is clear that teachers will always be needed in the classroom.

Following the analyzation of a teacher`s ability to cater to students as well as their capability of guiding students toward success, it is clear that technology will never replace teachers in the classroom. Further, it is expected that technology will act as a supplement to teachers and aid them in instructing their pupils. ",No,Yes,6.5
Some people think that new technology always improves the lives of workers Other people believe that it results in disadvantages for workers,"Varying views are on board regarding the impact of technology on the lives of employees. One faction of the society welcomed the changes brought by technology since modern technology has made the workers’ life comfortable and enjoyable. On the other hand, there are some people who argue against this contention. This essay, however, supports the former view and presents its arguments in the ensuing paragraphs.

First and foremost, it is an accredited fact that modern technology has bestowed a plethora of benefits upon workers. Primarily, telecommunication has enhanced the quality of life, as employees these days are leading a quite easy and relaxing life. For example, in the present scenario, employees can work from their home without any need to pay a visit at their office. Adding to this, this new change in work culture also resulted in an escalation of quality of work. Therefore, it is a win-win situation for both the employees and employers.

From a social point of view, the new work from home culture has let the employees to spend valuable time with their family members. To cite an example, the time saved from commuting between office and home would be devoted to family members. Furthermore, employees can also lend a helping hand to their counterparts in the household chores. Therefore, it is rational to state that new innovations have made the life of a working class quite amusing and comfortable.

However, the picture is not so rosy. Some people argue that this recent paradigm shift in work culture has more drawbacks than advantages. This view is born out of the fact that with the advent of computer and the Internet, employees are leading a more hectic and competitive life. Moreover, human is a social animal and social interaction with his peers is an integral part of his life. Unfortunately, this technology has dramatically dwindled the social interaction in other people. However, this is a short-sighted view.

After close scrutiny of the various aspects of the subject in question, it can be concluded that as every coin has two faces, similarly technology has both advantages and disadvantages to the workers. But, it can be safely stated that merits of advanced technological equipments used in industry easily outweigh its demerits to a great extent. ",No,Yes,6.5
"It said that the fast pace of our everyday life, as a direct result of the rapid development of telecommunication technology and the travel industry, has negative effects on individuals, nations, and the globe. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In today's world, the rapid pace of innovation in technology, communications, and travel, has led to dramatic changes in life and made it a fast life. Although these changes make life better in many ways, many, including me, believe that their disadvantages cannot be easily ignored.

The negative impacts of the fast-paced life resulting from the advancement of technology in both people’s interactions and movement, which is moving at an incredible speed, could be portrayed in three different scales; personal, national, and global. On a personal level, first of all, it is a fact that most people are under intense pressure and a lot of mental stress because they have to put tremendous effort into adapting themselves to this speed. Designers, for example, are faced with new gadgets and architectural applications that are introduced one after the other, creating a new challenge for them because they have to be up to date to get or keep their job. At the second scale (communities), it is obvious that family relationships are compromised because of the limited time that their members have to spend together and is accelerated by establishing virtual connections through social media such as Facebook or WhatsApp so many people may experience failed marriage, which is undoubtedly a problem for communities. On a universal scale, there is a myriad of technology-driven flights that not only does contribute to global warming but also increasing noise pollution. Every day, large amounts of carbon dioxide and other gases are being emitted into the atmosphere, which has a major impact on the climate system. Also, those who are close to airports are very affected by noise, they may face some problems such as sleep disorders.

Admittedly, it is true that advances in technology have made it more convenient for us to travel or communicate than ever before. For example, we can be in contact with a friend or family member via a state-of-the-art device even in out-of-the-way areas or be on the move to visit another part of the world. However, this cutting-edge technology has brought with it a whole new set of problems.

In conclusion, it appears that the satisfaction of a modern lifestyle, new experiences through the acquisition of advanced devices should not make us forget the side effects of these changes. We need to grasp the magnitude of the unfavorable effect in order to find effective solutions. ",No,Yes,6.5
Some old people today struggle with the use of modern technologies such as smartphones and computers. What is the cause of this? What are some possible solutions?,"As the 21st century continues to unfold, an array of new technologies have arisen, most of which were previously out of the reach of people's comprehension. Computers and cell-phones are patently obvious examples that may cause some elderlies to experience difficulties while using them. Although there are specific root causes related to this problem, effective policies can be adopted to remedy the situation.

There are two main reasons why the old more than others, struggle with keeping abreast of these state-of-the-art gadgets. First and foremost, people over the age of 50 or 60 are "" technology immigrants"". To illustrate, these days, children are born into a fast-changing technological world; they understand even from early ages how to work with these devices; therefore, they called ""technology native"". However, aged people have to acquire the knowledge and skill of using them, exactly like taking in a foreign language. Furthermore, they usually fail to receive sufficient instructions for use from people around, so it is easily perceivable why they prefer to live in an old-fashioned way.

There are, however, some workable solutions to help the senescent how to cope with contemporary society. One step would be education; by planning training schemes, the older adults can be exposed to the technology, so as to learning the skill would be more convenient. By means of these educational courses, which could be a simple video clip, they can determine how user-friendly and effective these gadgets are. Another alternative could be designing specific applications and programs suited to elderlies in order to motivate them.

To recapitulate, it is understandable that getting used to technological devices, barely conceivable a few decades ago, is not trouble-free; however, with the help of education and incentive programs, it is bound to be solvable. ",No,Yes,6.5

On the other hand, there are some people who argue against this contention. This essay, however, supports the former view and presents its arguments in the ensuing paragraphs.

First and foremost, it is an accredited fact that modern technology has bestowed a plethora of benefits upon workers. Primarily, telecommunication has enhanced the quality of life, as employees these days are leading a quite easy and relaxing life. For example, in the present scenario, employees can work from their home without any need to pay a visit at their office. Adding to this, this new change in work culture also resulted in an escalation of quality of work. Therefore, it is a win-win situation for both the employees and employers.

From a social point of view, the new work from home culture has let the employees to spend valuable time with their family members. To cite an example, the time saved from commuting between office and home would be devoted to family members. Furthermore, employees can also lend a helping hand to their counterparts in the household chores. Therefore, it is rational to state that new innovations have made the life of a working class quite amusing and comfortable.

However, the picture is not so rosy. Some people argue that this recent paradigm shift in work culture has more drawbacks than advantages. This view is born out of the fact that with the advent of computer and the Internet, employees are leading a more hectic and competitive life. Moreover, human is a social animal and social interaction with his peers is an integral part of his life. Unfortunately, this technology has dramatically dwindled the social interaction in other people. However, this is a short-sighted view.

After close scrutiny of the various aspects of the subject in question, it can be concluded that as every coin has two faces, similarly technology has both advantages and disadvantages to the workers. But, it can be safely stated that merits of advanced technological equipments used in industry easily outweigh its demerits to a great extent. ",No,Yes,6.5
"In the past, most people used to travel to their place of work. With increased use of computers, the internet and smart phones, more and more people are starting to work from home. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this development?","With the invention of the internet, our lives are facilitated in ways that were never imagined previously. The inclusion of computers and smartphones in our daily lives has brought many pleasant experiences as well as some problems.

Firstly, computers and smartphones have enabled us to work from home which is very helpful for people who have no one to take care of their children at home. Also, these advancements have provided workers with the opportunity of applying for jobs, in other countries far away from their place of living. Moreover, this globalization has given workers the advantage of flexible working hours without discomfort while sitting in their own homes. For instance, during Covid 19 outbreak worldwide, working from home has been an alternative to abide by the rules of social distancing to avoid virus spread.

The main disadvantage of working from home is the lack of social interaction, which in many cases can affect the psychological well-being of workers. While flexible timings are an advantage but in many circumstances, people find it difficult to meet the deadlines due to several distractions at home. A viral video of a politician constantly interrupted by his son during an interview is a great example to show how the cozy and comfortable environment of the home can turn into a major distraction.

To conclude, I think a peaceful environment with flexible working hours is as important as a social circle to maintain one's mental health. Thus, the best solution is to provide adjustable working hours with a few days to work at the job place and a few days to work at home. ",No,Yes,6.5
Some old people today struggle with the use of modern technologies such as smartphones and computers. What is the cause of this? What are some possible solutions?,"As the 21st century continues to unfold, an array of new technologies have arisen, most of which were previously out of the reach of people's comprehension. Computers and cell-phones are patently obvious examples that may cause some elderlies to experience difficulties while using them. Although there are specific root causes related to this problem, effective policies can be adopted to remedy the situation.

There are two main reasons why the old more than others, struggle with keeping abreast of these state-of-the-art gadgets. First and foremost, people over the age of 50 or 60 are "" technology immigrants"". To illustrate, these days, children are born into a fast-changing technological world; they understand even from early ages how to work with these devices; therefore, they called ""technology native"". However, aged people have to acquire the knowledge and skill of using them, exactly like taking in a foreign language. Furthermore, they usually fail to receive sufficient instructions for use from people around, so it is easily perceivable why they prefer to live in an old-fashioned way.

There are, however, some workable solutions to help the senescent how to cope with contemporary society. One step would be education; by planning training schemes, the older adults can be exposed to the technology, so as to learning the skill would be more convenient. By means of these educational courses, which could be a simple video clip, they can determine how user-friendly and effective these gadgets are. Another alternative could be designing specific applications and programs suited to elderlies in order to motivate them.

To recapitulate, it is understandable that getting used to technological devices, barely conceivable a few decades ago, is not trouble-free; however, with the help of education and incentive programs, it is bound to be solvable. ",No,Yes,6.5
"As computers are being used more and more in education, there will be soon no role for teachers in the classroom","Nowadays, technology is developing in many countries. Computer is on of the common technology which has been used in different environment such as teaching, hospital and shopping. Especially, schools are being used computer more common in education rather than the role of teach in class room. However, using computer or classroom teach always advantages and disadvantage in education.

"Labour-saving devices such as dishwashers and communication tools such as computers are supposed to make our lives easier. However, some people argue that these devices only make them more difficult. Does modern technology reduce or increase stress? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. You should write at least 250 words.","It is undeniable that modern technology has brought various kinds of labour-saving devices such as communication tools and dishwashers. Although contemporary generation people lives become easier by using these devices, some elderly individuals think that these devices make their lives more complicated. I believe advanced technology is suitable for young generation people because saves a lot of time as well as it reduces stress.

To begin with, the young generation people are often depending on advanced technology. This is because it saves time and energy; they do not require to put a lot of pressure. For instance, if we use washing machines to wash clothes, they do this work within a few minutes without wasting our energy. As a result, people can get a lot of time for themselves to do leisure activities and spend with their family members.

However, older generation people are not familiar with these electronic devices and they often face difficulties to use them. As they are unfamiliar with this new equipment, this may create a lot of stress for them. Therefore, they would prefer to do things manually. For instance, a survey conducted by the Delhi University found that more than 59% of elderly people refused to use of electronic gadgets such as mobiles and computers. Hence, it is a completely personal choice.

In conclusion, for the contemporary generation, it may reduce their stress and saves time. In contrast, the older generation people believe that it gives them more stress due to their unfamiliarity with these devices. ",No,Yes,6
"Over the years, technology has become easier and more efficient to help incorporate into our everyday lives and that include social interacting.","Over the years, technology has become easier and more efficient to help incorporate into our everyday lives and that include social interacting. Communicating through using modern technologies has become one of the main aspects of everyones lives and thus it is important to foresee how it can impact relationships and if it is a positive and negative, because is technology really important for communicating these days? This essay will try to answer the question and also talk about how relationships has changed due to technology but also how it can be exploited for crimes to be preformed.

Technology has amplified the social interactions an individual can have which in return has pushed many people into relationships whether it being superficial or a very trusting one. Technology has improved the communications between people due to how easy it became to generally talk to people and how easy it is to convey feelings to other individuals. For instance, social media found in many technologies became the most popular platform for socializing with various people and thus allowed relationships to be formed through using the internet. Another good example is that texting overall became the number one form of communication between people due to how easy it is to write one's feelings and emotions especially to people that have social anxiety. Furthermore, technology has been the reason of many new relationships but that does not mean that those formed relationships can be classified as good or as healthy.

With technology being the main source of socializing in the 21st century, there has been an increase of negative impact it had with creating relationships. Technology has become an outlet for people to interact without the need of knowing one's identity and thus it can become quite dangerous especially to young adolescents. To illustrate, there has been many cases of crimes being conducted through interacting with strangers online where people could lie about their identities, and so many crimes such as kidnapping and human trafficking has increased and became easier due to the introduction of technology. So, everyone should be careful on who they are interacting with and what information is being shared.

In the end, technology still is important for communicating and forming relationships due to how easy social interactions became along with how simple people could talk with each other without disclosing personal information. Although it became a stable in our lives, it still has a negative impact where there has been a series of crimes initiated through using technology. ",No,Yes,6.5
Nowadays many people have access to computers on a wide basis and a large number of children play computer games. What are the negative impacts of children playing computer games and what can be done to minimize the bad effects?,"People use computers more extensively these days than ever before, and it is so widespread in our modern world that even children have access to these devices for playing games or watching videos. This essay discusses the disadvantages of playing digital games on computer devices by youngsters and suggests some measures to reduce such negative effects.

Concerning the adverse impacts of young children playing video games, the most devastating one is the addiction these games create. Millions of dollar are spent to make computer games so that they attract a large number of audience and keep them glued to the computer screens. So they are addictive by design and this obsession hampers children's outdoor activities, studies and even time to socialise and learn important life skills. Many research works suggest that children who spend many hours playing computer games end up performing poorly in schools and avoid social events and outdoor activities. This results in physical and psychological issues including poor eyesight and despair. Moreover, violent games cloud the youngsters' judgement and make their rational thinking unstable. Oftentimes, youngsters who play violent games develop violent behaviours.

To minimise the severity of these negative impacts, parents must monitor what their children are doing, especially on computers. They should not be allowed to play computer games more than a couple of hours each week and parents can actively take part in those games with their children so that it becomes family time. Children's outdoor activities should be taken seriously and parents should take them out whenever possible. Finally, parents can use parental control on the digital contents and games their children watch or play. This would deter children from downloading and playing games that are not suitable for their age.

To conclude, computer games, when played excessively by children, have many detrimental effects. Proper parenting and monitoring seem like the best solution to solve these problems. ",No,Yes,6.5
Some people believe that computers are more a hindrance than a help in today's world. Others feel that they are such indispensable tools that they would not be able to live or work without them. In what ways are computers a hindrance? What is your opinion?,"In a modern world where opinions are greatly magnified by media, the perception on the use of computers remain divided. It is deemed as a hindrance since it has a tendency to diminish the concept of ""hard work, "" as the boomer generation would say. Some of them claim that the entitlement of millennials is due to their lack of experience in harnessing the value of patience. Another is when computers disrupt the market demand of several industries. For example, magazine publishing companies are now shifting from print to the digital age by launching their websites with the aid of social media influencers. In effect, this will lessen the production of paper as factories will eventually cease their operations.

On the other hand, computers are also recognized as indispensable, especially when the pandemic affected every person across the globe this year. A lot of industries shut down, countries had economic recessions, commercial stores and restaurants had to close, and people had to find ways to keep their jobs running by working remotely. From face-to-face meetings, seminars and conferences, a great proportion of the labor force now resorted to webinars, online rendezvous, and regular email exchanges.

In my opinion, the necessity of this technological system has proved itself time and time again, especially in this period of global transition. Is this inevitable, you may ask? Computers play a huge part in our lives as it transformed the way we communicate, do our work, collaborate, and share information. On a personal note, if I don't have a computer, I might not be able to function without it since it has provided me with every convenience that I can access. Embracing the advancements that came along with it will help us appreciate that the world is on the right track towards development, innovation, and problem-solving. ",No,Yes,6.5

This essay below will analyze both pros and cons of this issue.

On the one hand, the utilization of computers in study is advantageous in some certain aspects. Firstly, whenever we go to a shop, school or college, due to the computer, it is primitive for us to find anything that we are looking for. Likewise, if we have to find a book from an enormous library, because of location saved in computer, we can straightforwardly find it without wasting time. More importantly, it has a wide range of opportunities; such as it works without any tiredness, moreover computers perform any labor in a perfect manner with cleanliness.

On the other hand, demerits of using electronic computers on study are varied. Initially, in recent times, we are utilizing from computers continuously, so it impairs our eyes. It is true we can wear special glasses, however, in this case our eyes would become weaker and water starts coming from our eyes. Apart from this, if we connect the internet on a computer, after that radiation of the internet does harm to us. Additionally, if there any young children near to us they may suffer more, furthermore, it is scientifically proven that radiation effects more on birds and they forget the way due to the radiation and also might pass away.

In conclusion, despite some drawbacks in terms of radiation of birds and young children, using computers on studying purposes would increase the productivity of work. ",No,Yes,6.5
Some people believe that technology has made the lives of workers easier whilst other people disagree.

While a part of society tend to think that technology provides numerous opportunities which are appropriate to ease employees works and enhance lives, there are some people who has opposite opinion. Even though I'm on the side of the first idea, this essay will discuss opposite view too.

Firstly, it is an admitted fact that modern technology has benefits upon workers. Primarily, communication has enhanced the quality of life, as employees these days have easy and relaxing life. For example, in these days, employees can work from their home without any need to go to their office. Thereby this new change in work culture also resulted in enhancement of the quality of work.

Furthermore, employees may also lend a help or have spare time to their acquaintances in some activities such as home chores. Hence, the features and innovations that technology ensured us have made our life joyful and amusing.

On the other hand, some people reckon that technology has more drawbacks than benefits. This idea is emerged of the fact that the invention of computer and the Internet are leading employee to more hectic and competitive life. Moreover, humans are social beings and social interaction is a vital and integral part of life. Unfortunately, it is unalterable fact that technology obliges human become estranged from social interaction in other people. However, this view is not acknowledged by majority of people.

To conclude, similarly technology has both advantages and disadvantages to the workers. But, it can be embarked safely that benefits of technology used in industry easily outweigh its drawback. ",No,Yes,6.5

You should write at least 250 words in IELTS writing task 2.,"It is thought that families’ life will improve when the technology is less advanced. From our perspective, we strongly agree with this statement. In this article, our point of view will be outlined and discussed.

Dwindling expectation of life is a result of advanced technology. Families’ mental health will decrease noticeably because of electronic devices. Take brain illnesses as a good instance. Young people who are addicted to smart phone will lead to be crazy. It causes them to work unproductively. The percentage of teenagers’ death will rise continuously. Secondly, elder people find it hard to access the technology. It is very annoying that they ought to depend on their children, especially the young.

The complex technology has a negative impact on the life of older people.

One solution should be on individuals to tackle this issue is to get rid of using technological devices as much as possible. A better health will occur. My father, for instance, used to waste his time to use his phone so much, sequentially, he spends more time to work out and do more housework, which make him happier. We will get rid of the illnesses and live longer. On the other hand, it is necessary for the government to ban manufacturing electronic devices for families, which will make a better life. People will not depend on these anymore, which causes a harmless life.

"MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT MODERN TECHNOLOGY HAS MADE PEOPLE MORE SOCIABLE, WHILE OTHERS THINK THAT IT HAS ISOLATED THEM. DISCUSS BOTH IDEAS","Some people think that recent technological advances have boosted friendships and social bonds. On the contrary, others believe that high tech may lead to social isolation.

To begin with, there are some positive aspects of high technology and their social impact. Socially speaking, one tangible effect may be tied to how social networks have changed people's lives worldwide. In today's world, interaction starts by turning on a smart gadget wherever we are and no matter the time. We can draw the conclusion that this is a collaboration of how technology, science and companies working together have made people's connection easier. What is more, this seems to have given room to some particular activities such as online finances, trading and even online health where technology seems to be playing a colossal impact.

Secondly, many sociologists believe that young generations are turning more socially distant and reluctant, jeopardizing social bonds. That is why for many people there are some drawbacks linked to technology's influence on social relationships.

Recent surveys have shown that most communications are taking place through smart gadgets and this may contribute to some distractions such as secondary advertisements. This information of adds might become more relevant than their own sociability promoting solitary activities.

Do you think technology can make the world better?,"Nowadays, with the rapid development of the technology, it becomes an important part of humans’ life. Some people think that technology has made the world a better place to live, but some people do not agree with this idea. I, however, think that technology has made the world a higher quality place to live because it improves our transportation, it is convenient and it is comfortable.

Firstly, with the modern technology, people can have many kinds of transportations. At the past, people had to go by bicycle or on foot; it is really difficult for people to move far away. So in the early 19 century, people with some technology had made the first motorbike to remove that problem. Furthermore, today we have many airplanes, cars, ships, vessels to help us to travel easily.

Secondly, technology is extremely convenient for people, especially for many people who live far from their family. For example, my uncle has lived and worked in America for 15 years, but my grandmother and my family are living in Vietnam so that it is very difficult to contact with him face to face. In spite of that, we can contact him through email or telephone calls. Furthermore, it is extremely helpful when you have to face up to an emergency situation. For instance, a few days ago, I need to bring my research for my literature class and I had left if at home. So I was totally worried because it is the deadline of the research. If I did not hand in the paper, I would have gotten a worse score. Then, in this case, I had to call my father to bring it to me. Thus, it is highly convenient for many people.

Finally, I assume that technology is really comfortable. It is the summer in Vietnam now, it is extremely hot. However, sitting in the air-conditioned room, people do not have to suffer from the hot weather anymore. Thank for the modern technology, today, people do not need to be in the trouble with the hot weather or cold weather.

"Over the last two or three decades, the way that business is done has changed dramatically due to major advances in technology. As a result, a growing number of people are now choosing to work from the comfort of their own home. However, is the development positive, or are there more drawbacks than advantages?","The advancement in technology had made our life more easier in various aspects. In today's world, business can also be done from home as a result, numerous pupil choose to work from their own home. Despite of its positive development there are also some drawbacks of it. In this essay, I will explore both the pros and cons of working from home and try to draw some conclusions.

On the one hand, there are some advantages of working from home such as it helps us to save money, time and it will be easy for disabled people to work from home. Most of the individual have to go their office through vehicle either by bus or bike which may takes a lot of time. Firstly, By working through home it helps them to save their time and even to save money which is spent on transportation expenses. Secondly, For the handicap people who are permanently injured it makes them comfortable to perform their task in their own home. For instance, the disable individual who feel uncomfortable to work in office can perform their task with confident at their home.

On the other hand, I think that there are also several disadvantages such as less communication with staff and not being able to get knowledge from their seniors. If all the staffs work together at office then they will share their ideas and views with each other about the task and they will gain more information and method from one another. Furthermore, By looking at the performance of their senior staffs they can improve their ability to work. So, If the people work from home then they have to rely on their own ideas, they cannot learn from their seniors and they cannot see their friends performance.

To conclude, It seems to me that the drawbacks of working at their own home are more than its advantage as it is more important to learn new ideas and concepts with will automatically helps for future. ",Yes,No,6

persuading manufacturers and travelers to adopt the new technology of producing and using electric cars would be more effective strategy for improving air quality.,"I agree with the writer's views that persuading manufacturers and travelers to adopt the new technology of producing and using electric cars would be more effective strategy for improving air quality. The application of new production technology that uses clean fuel and the use of electric cars will significantly reduce emissions to the environment. Because clean fuel sources such as wind, solar, hydroelectricity, biology, … have some inherent properties that make them cleaner than conventional gasoline. These fuels emit fewer hydrocarbons, and the hydrocarbons they release are less reactive (slower to ozone formation) and less toxic. Emissions from electricity, natural gas, or alcohol-powered vehicles can be 90% less toxic and more ozone-forming hydrocarbons than emissions from conventional gasoline-powered vehicles. When applying production technology using clean fuel such as using solar panels to generate electricity for production, minimizing the use of petrol-powered machinery and equipment will promote the reduction of emissions from the factories. As for electric cars, they emit almost no CO2 when we drive them, thereby helping to reduce CO2 emissions, smoke, and dust into the air, resulting in improved air quality and protecting human health. Thus, the application of clean fuel technology to the production and use of electric vehicles will contribute to improving the quality of the atmosphere, while reducing the greenhouse effect and the phenomenon of the Earth's gradual warming.

Some people think computer is very important for personal use.but some believe it has harmful impact on persons,"Experts throughout both the developing and developed world have debated whether the advent of sophisticated modern technology such as mobile phones, laptops and iPad have helped to enhance and improve people's social lives or whether the opposite has become the case.

Personally, I strongly advocate the former view. This essay will discuss both sides using examples from the UK government and Oxford University to demonstrate points and prove arguments.

On the one hand there is ample, powerful, almost daily evidence that such technology can be detrimental especially to the younger generation who are more easily affected by it’s addictive nature and which can result in people feeling more isolated from the society.

The central reason behind this is twofold, firstly, the invention of online social media sites and apps, such as Twitter and Facebook have reduced crucial face-to-face interactions dramatically. Through use of these appealing and attractive mediums, people feel in touch and connected yet lack key social skills and the ability to communicate.

Secondly, dependence on such devices is built up frighteningly easily which may have a damaging effect on mental health and encourage a sedentary lifestyle. For example, recent scientific research by the UK government demonstrated that 90% of people in their 30s spend over 20 hours per week on Messenger and similar applications to chat with their friends instead of meeting up and spending quality time together or doing sport. As a result, it is conclusively clear that these technology advancements have decreased and diminished our real life interactions.

On the other hand, although there are significant downsides to technological developments, its’ multifold advantages cannot be denied. This is largely because the popularity of technology such as cellphones allows people to connect freely and easily with no geographical barriers.

People are able to share any type of news, information, photos and opinions with their loved ones whenever and wherever they want therefore keeping a feeling of proximity and closeness. For example, an extensive study by Oxford University illustrated that people who work, or study abroad and use applications like Facetime and WhatsApp to chat with their families, are less likely to experience loneliness and feel out of the loop than those who do not.

Consistent with this line of thinking is that businessmen are also undoubtedly able to benefit from these advances by holding virtual real -time meetings using Skype which may increase the chance of closing business deals without the need to fly.

From the arguments and examples given I firmly believe that overall communication and mans’ sociability has been advanced enormously due to huge the huge technological progress of the past twenty years and despite some potentially serious health implications which governments should not fail to address, it is predicted that its popularity will continue to flourish in the future.
