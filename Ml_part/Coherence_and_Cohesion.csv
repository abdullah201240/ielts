some field executive in large companies should receive high salaries while others think they are paid too much compared to ordinary workers discuss both views and give your own opinion,"It is often considered that, of late, multinational companies play an indispensable role in employees life. It has been providing a significant concern in all over the world. A sea change has been witnessed in the past few years. As per the stated notion, large firms should promotion their senior workers whereas others argue that, they paid high wages than ordinary workers.

To embark on, their are major concerns why organisation's paid too much salary to wage earner. First and foremost several workers have ample experience regarding job and skills which is considered having had a efficacious effect on both the individual and organisation. For instance, if he or she has a good quality of leadership and sustainable responsible it would develop a deeper understanding will stand their performance or ability. Thus, owner should reward to their senior member for enhancing inspiration.

On the other hand, it is generally believed that some companies give less salary to ordinary workers. on a wider spectrum, alot of English to education which would reap the benefits of globalisation, For instance if person do not have a capable of responsibility for effective work so executive do not paid too much salary. Hence, it is not a contributing factor.

To recapitulate, each work is unique with its on way of life and on perspective of the world which would enhance knowledge, I strongly believe that organisations should paid incentives to responsible employers. ",No,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5
Children are getting 10% weight from past year.Give your causes and effects?,"It is often argued that in western society, the rate of overweight child has been increased around 20% in terms of 10 years. There are many causes and effects which would be discuss in following fragment.

The main causes and effects for overweight children is due to their food habitat and lack of physical exercise. Many children at present days like to eat junk food outside which is bad to our health.

"Scientists predict in the near future cars will be driven by computers, not people. Why? Do you think it is a positive or negative development?","In the upcoming years, cars and other vehicles are projected to be driven automatically by computers. From my perspective, this phenomenon brings more advantages than disadvantages.

First, there are several driving forces behind this forecast. Steadily increasing budget from the government and giant corporations has brought about groundbreaking advances in robotics technology. The last few decades have witnessed robots gradually takes over manufacturing jobs previously done by human. Soon enough, automation will become a ubiquitous presence in our daily life, handling a variety of tasks including driving. In addition, given that traffic accidents are on the rise, especially in densely populated cities, self-driving cars could be the answer to reduce fatalities. Simply by taking human emotions and errors out of the equation, autopilot mode could indeed save millions of lives from car crash incidence.

Having said that, the benefits of autonomous cars certainly outweigh the drawbacks. Operated with a high degree of precision, self-driving vehicles can greatly reduce average commuter times in metropolitan areas, offering many spin-off advantages from well-being to boosting the economy. Besides, with driverless cars able to access up-to-the-minute data to help monitor traffic, as well as digital maps and other tools, they could determine the fastest, most efficient route possible. All of this will result in less congestion, less time-consuming and fuel waste.

In short, growing level of automation in this modern era is inevitable. More specifically, the emergence of self-driving technology is around the corner and despite initial concerns, this should be perceived as a positive trend.",No,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5
The animal species are becoming extinct due to human activities on land and in sea. What are the reasons and solutions?,"It’s frightening that myriads of terrestrial and marine animals are on the verge of extinction due to human beings. My essay will shed light on the causes and measures to this issue.

To begin with, the constant tampering of nature by human has led to drastic changes in the natural world resulting in animals and plants finding it more difficult and difficult to survive. Nearly every kind of habitat or ecosystem - be it land, air or water - has been affected by the uncontrollable destruction of habitats by human. The impact of humans taking land for buildings, farming and timber has rendered species extinct at speeds unprecedented in Earth’s history. Besides, humans, due to their industrial, agricultural, or normal day-to-day activities, release an inordinate amount of toxic waste that is eventually dumped into the air, water or landfills. Tragedies like oil spills have been known to destroy and threaten many aquatic life forms.

Having said that, rapid, greatly intensified efforts to address the problem, slowing the extinctions currently underway. First, each government should levy exorbitant fines on devastating behaviors such as littering, illegal dumping or other environmental offences. The implementation of stringent laws, accompanied by extensive media coverage of the issue would raise environmental awareness among all sections of the society. Second, international organizations such as the United Nations should coordinate activities among member countries as well as encourage participation by the private sectorto promote sustainable use of the world’s natural resources. Specifically, the presence of such inter-governmental organizations plays a major role in initiating negotiations on reducing industrial pollution level or other toxic waste.

In short, the blame for the most recent mass extinction is not natural calamities - it’s human. Therefore, several solutions need to be done to tackle this worrying trend and save endangered species from the brink of extinction. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6.5
"some people think all lawbreakers should be put into prison, while others believe that there are better alternatives. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","We have witnessed many crimes in modern society. It is argued that all of the lawbreakers should be sent to jail, while others think that there are better alternative choices for lawbreakers to amend themselves. In my opinion, these statements are reasonable.

It is certainly true that lawbreakers should be taken into the prison for some reasons. One of the reasons is that this policy can to protect the inhabitants of cities. Lawbreakers usually commit crimes that will bring harms to the others such as stealing and robbing. By sending crime offenders to prisons, it can ensure that the society safety. As a result, citizens subsequently would feel that the society is peaceful and secured. Another reason is that this action reduce the crime rate. By strictly imposing punishment to criminals, it will decrease the level of crime rate because it has deterrent effects. Consequently, people would give up the thought of committing crimes.

However, there are opposing voices saying that there are better ways to solve this problem. To begin with, the government should offer jobs to criminals. Re-offenders, in most cases, are struggling with extremely limited income in their lives. Given secured jobs and reasonable payments, they naturally can learn some practical skills such as computer skills. Therefore, they will not risk their liberty because they live like ordinary residents with sufficient income. Apart from this, the government should provide free education to them. Due to leak of educating in the past, perpetrators were unable to judge what was right and wrong things to do. Being significantly educating, they will become good members and will not return to crime.",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,5
"Multicultural societies, in which there is a mixture of different ethnic peoples, bring more benefits than drawbacks to a country. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own experience or knowledge","Thanks to more widely open policies in economy and immigration of many countries, the 21st century has witnessed the surprisingly increasing formation of multicultural societies where a varying number of ethnic people stay together. Although it has both positive and negative effects to a country, it seems to me that we are more likely to obtain more benefits than disadvantages from this kind of society.

The more diverse the residents of a country are, the more cultural values they can share to enhance their awareness and knowledge of culture and tradition. People will get more directly engaged in understanding unique customs or rituals, life and work attitudes from their foreign neighbours, colleagues and friends. As a consequence, they enable to adapt the cultural diversity in order to develop their interpersonal skills and live closer to other cultures without having to live in person in another country.

Additionally, once people can know more about each other through everyday interactions at work or schools, the severe conflicts or even wars will be remarkably alleviated. It is undeniable that there might have some drawbacks that multicultural communities bring to a country. Racial disparity accelerated, the wealth-poverty gap deteriorated, different culture tensions are specific cases for what are the so-called drawbacks, but the inhabitants can overcome these when the government implement friendly-ethnic peoples’ policies, as well as the dwellers, have positive thoughts and behaviours to live compatibly with others.

Stimulating multiculturalism in a society will offer numerous advantages to a country rather than undesirable effects. Therefore, each individual should savour every rewarding moment of living in their multicultural community and proudly spread their unique traditions to international friends so as to increase the diversity.

Some people say that the only reason for learning reason for learning a foreign language is in order to travel to or work in a foreign country. Others say that these are not the only reasons why someone should learn a foreign language. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.,"There are a variety of reasons why people should learn a foreign language. Some people say that the only reason is to live or work overseas. On the other hand, others believe that there are many more reasons. In my opinion, travel and work abroad should not the only motives.

Undoubtedly, traveling and working overseas are the most common reasons for learning a new language. When people decide to work and settle away from their countries, there are many struggles, and one of them is cultural barriers. However, knowing the native language can help newcomers overcome the problems easier. Besides that, partially or fully understand the local language can make travelers enjoy their trips more. On the other hand, , because there are more and more unemployed workers, employers also have higher expectations, and knowing (that) another language would be a great advantage. In short, knowing another language is necessary for jobs and travel abroad.

On the other hand, , there are other benefits of knowing a foreign. Some studies show that the brains of bilinguals think and work differently from normal ones. Bilinguals can take in information, and they process it more complex and diverse. As a result, knowing a new language broaden our mind. We can think from various perspectives, and we will know more about the world around us.

In conclusion, in my opinion, knowing a foreign language can help us in jobs and travel. However, besides that, there are many benefits and reasons why we should learn a new language.",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,5
Newspapers and books are outdated. Why do some people believe this? What is your opinion?,"The twenty-first century illustrates an increasing number of people are relying on new forms of technology. A possible consequence of this is that traditional media such as books and newspapers are not common, and these documents are considered to be outdated. Personally, I disagree with this point of view, books and newspapers should be a basic way of saving knowledge and traditional culture.

The principal reason that some people give this view is discovering information in the global from the internet or multimedia such as television, podcast channel is much quicker and easier. For instance, if people use Google or another search engine, they can instantly get the latest news. The fact that technology gives more convenience in browsing information, but most of these are the fast-moving news, and when an individual wants to research or directly interact with the words, in reality, the traditional platform such as research reports, academic notebooks are more essential than the high-technical platform.

Furthermore, reading print books and newspapers can be better for the brain and health. Because readers of print books absorb and remember more of the plot than readers of e-books or digital magazines. For example, many jobs require people to stare at a computer screen all day, and it will give their eyes a break. Electronic books can cause screen fatigue, which may lead to blurred vision, dryness, and irritation, with print books, those problems do not occur any more. In addition, researchers believe that if readers have a books or personal library at home, they will be more likely to link to higher academic achievement.

E-books and internet platforms would be more convenient than traditional books. But the important thing is reading on paper books can enrich the entire experience, and readers will not be got sidetracked more easily than digital readers. Thus, traditional reading will not be outdated. ",Yes,No,No,No,No,No,5.5
Depression and anxiety disorders among Adults,"Nowadays, the most of Adults constantly face with the stress, problems in their business life, private life. All of these worsen them morally and cause depression, anxiety, social phobia which completely frustrate their mental health and the foremost their life.

On one hand, from my point of view, Adults are charge of so many responsibilities such as about their children’s future, job, family affairs, meeting their child’s needs, etc. and each of them causes stress on middle-aged people. That is way disorders as depression and anxiety usually occur on Adults. In my opinion, it is mainly bound up business life that they spare the most of their day in there. Actually this depends on the type of work. Some jobs may be so stressful, for instance, profession of a doctor. Saving someone’s life requires too much responsibility and self-sacrifice and from my stand point, such as professions results anxiety. However place of doctors is undeniable in our life.

On another hand, one of liability of Adults is about their children. They have to meet their needs as affording their education, buying them necessary things and sometimes they think more and more deeply about it. They consider that what if I am laid off, cannot meet my child’s significant needs. Hence, All of these thoughts make them depressed and create uneasiness on them.

To sum up, What they need is to chill out, think less and occasionally walking away from responsibilities. Unless they do it, they will deal with diverse illnesses, due to it is evident fact that depression and anxiety create harmful diseases like cancer.",No,No,No,No,No,No,5.5

Nowadays, most people live in large cities where they only know a few people in their area. What do you think were the advantages and disadvantages of living in a small community?

But let's focus on the past, what was the advantages and disadvantages of a living in a small communities.

I think advantages of living in a small communities was people didn't feel awkward with each other because they were close. If any of family in the village had a emergency problem, they can called help from other quickly because there house were against to each other,

About the disadvantages of living in a small villages was they got bored of their neighboor and people surrounded them because they were too similar. They didn't get a choice to communicate with new people outside their area so their social communication skill was limited. They didn't have many new friends.

Major environmental problem,"Many people think that the loss of particular plants and animal species is the major environmental problem that humans are facing nowadays, while others believe that some environmental issues are more alarming. I agree with the latter view and will analyze both views in the following essay.

On the one hand, the loss of animal and plant species is considered a main environmental problem because of its impact on our planet’s biodiversity. Around the world, trees are being cut down for industrial and agricultural purposes. As a result, there will not be enough trees to produce oxygen for humans and prevent the soil from washing away. Meanwhile, endangered animals are being poached to serve people’s needs, hence negatively affecting the whole ecosystem. For example, when sharks are killed for their fins, many types of aquatic species no longer have their natural predators to control their population. Consequently, the disappearance of predators disrupts the natural food chain and then leads to unbalanced underwater ecosystems.

On the other hand, there are more urgent environmental issues that exist aside from the loss of plant and animal species. Those problems including pollution and climate change are the main factors that cause the loss of biodiversity and put the natural habitat on the brink of destruction. Water and soil pollution caused by industrial and agricultural activities are poisoning a large number of species of marine and land animals, which means that human health is also negatively affected as those animals are humans’ important food source. Moreover, changing weather patterns caused by climate change lead to more frequent occurrences of natural disasters such as droughts, floods, and wildfires.

In conclusion, the loss of particular plants and animals should indeed be paid great attention to, but other environmental issues should also be taken into consideration. I think we should put a great deal of effort into tackling all of those problems rather than only focusing on the animals and plants’ extinction.",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6.5
Individuals can do nothing to improve the environment; only governments and large companies can make a difference.,"Some people say that there is no need for any individual to help for the improvement of the environment because they believe that it only depends on the performance of the government and huge companies. I totally disagree to this idea. I believe that every individual is important through participating and encouraging awareness to all.

Everyone is essential. Any good plans for the betterment of the environment has to be started by an individual. The goal will only be achieve if every part of the community will participate. For example, the government had announce about the global warming prevention and tips on how to do it, they need the participation of every individual so that the goal may be accomplish, because if people will only hear about it without any action from them, the goal will not be met.

Also, any individual can be an instrument to encourage awareness to all that they will encounter. If anyone had been intentionally doing his/her part for the project, the outcome will be positive. One good example is being member of a family, let us say that the mother heard about the project of the government to save the earth by starting from segregating garbage in different ways which are garbage, recycling and compost. The mom can be a good encourager by first doing it by herself, then next is to teach her husband and kids to do it as well. This is a good contribution to the government's project that may lead to a positive outcome.",Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,6.5

"Some people think that the government should provide assistance to all kinds of artists including painters, musicians and poets. However, other people think that this is a waste of money. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Many people lives are richer because of their art which they express to community. Many individual believe that the government should provide funds to artist while other believe that it is unfair. This essay analyse both the perspectives.

To begin with former views, there are many points that authority should help artists. Artists are contribute to nation by their art. Creativity is having in every person by their born but to elaborate it is a vital thing for any individual and all artist do that. At the end, they serve their creativity to their community for entertain perpose. Additionally, artist represent their culture by their art so, they become ambassador of their nation. For an example, painters represent their art by emboss as well as sculpture represent by carving and engraving and could be popular worldwide and express their tradition.

Moving to a latter view counter of former view having a strong reasons. Government should firstly focus on basic need for developing country. Individual's primary need is accommodation shelter and food yet, many individual has not get it. For well being life of human is a foremost priority for authority and still thye focus on other art instead this primary things. Additionally, they should also focus on infrastructure development. Nation want to add their name in developed country, foremost of it is developed their urban, ruler and their transportation by providing more found in it.

Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Equality between men and women has always been an issue in societies all around the world. Some believe that universities ought to consent to equal numbers of male and female students in all subjects. However, I disagree on this issue that the capacity of each subject should be equal for men and women students due to the lack of practicality and fairness.

The first reason that the numbers of male and female students accepted by universities should not be equal in every subject is that it will definitely be impractical. since some subjects are not appropriate and also not popular for both genders, the opportunity for students of one gender in a specific subject might be eliminated. For an instance, some subjects such as nursing, clothes designing, and interior designing are more popular among female students whereas some other subjects such as civil engineering and mechanics are more desirable for male students. In addition, job opportunities may be influenced by this issue. If there was a shortage of male mechanics, some of the subject-related projects would not be carried out.

Another good reason for inequality in the numbers of male and female students in all university subjects can be the fact that it will not be fair. Some meritorious students may lose their chance to be accepted in the particular subject if the capacity of the course is divided equally, which is frustrating for students. So, I believe that the numbers of seats for each subject should not be based on the gender.

In conclusion, universities ought not to accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject due to being practical and fair. The capacity of each subject had better be based on merit not gender.",Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,6
"As most people spend a major of their adult life at work, job satisfaction is an important element of individual wellbeing. What factors contribute to job satisfaction? How realistic is the expectation of job satisfaction for all workers?","Undoubtedly, a full-time job has always been an integral part of most people’s lives. Since it is said that majority of the adult life is dedicated to working, job satisfaction is a significant element in people’s health and happiness. There are several factors which can lead to job satisfaction. However, I believe the expectation that all people can be satisfied with their working condition and get full enjoyment is unrealistic.

There are several factors which can result in job satisfaction. Firstly, workers’ interests might be influential in enjoying the work they carry out. In my opinion, the stronger interests people have in their job, the higher motivation they get to take on the work and do it properly. Another effective factor can be the sense of fulfillment workers feel after work completion and getting promotion. When they monitor their progress day by day, for example, they get motivated and it may lead to higher sense of responsibility they develop. Besides, they become good team players and can co-operate with others well. The last but not least, the amount of money people gain as the salary can play an important role in job satisfaction. When people get more money in a fulfilling job, they get encouraged to carry out their work with the sense of happiness and satisfaction.

Of course, all people in a society are not expected to enjoy their working conditions. Sometimes, the need for money forces people to find a permanent job regardless of their interests. For instance, due to the rising inflation in my country, people have to find a well-paid job or work overtime just for gaining money. They have to overwork, therefore, to make a living and there sometimes seems to be no balance between their work and life and they cannot spend their time with their family members and friends and enjoy their lives; which may lead to physical or mental health problems.

In conclusion, even though there are a lot of factors such as people’s interests, stimulating working conditions, and income which cause job satisfaction, it is unrealistic expectation that all workers are likely to be satisfied and content with their jobs.",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,5.5
"Nowadays, protection of environment has been one of the critical issues for human being.","Nowadays, protection of environment has been one of the critical issues for human being. The protection of our future must be realised only with the ensurence of preservation of nature. However, environmetal problems ranges quite wide from pollution of air, water and soil to destruction of nature as deforestation and desertification. Therefore, some say that individuals has no influence over the solution of these issues and that government and large companies must be attributed. In my opinion, all of them, that is, individuals, government and large commercial companies are responsible in improving the environment. I will discuss this in this essay. First of all, the influence of individuals is not negligible. The cumulative, mass opinion must play important role over its government in policy desicion. The government would lagislate against air/water pollution or destrustion of nature which in turn does not allow commercial companies act against law. If individuals are not concerned of environment, government would allow companies' commercial activities without any sanction against destruction of nature. In 1960s when Japanese economy was thriving rapidly, a lot of companies developed its factories and manufactured its product ignoring environmental effect. In the result, some companies caused serious pollution which killed thousand of innocent people. Now there are strict regulations in Japan to prevent companies from causing serious environmental problems. To sum up, all these three factors; observation of citizens, rule of law, action of company are indispensable for the improvement of environment. If even one of them is missing other two would not fanction.",No,No,Yes,No,No,No,5
Individuals can do nothing to improve the environment; only governments and large companies can make a difference.,"The responsibility of environmental conservation has sparked an intense discussion among the community. Some say that citizens could not pay any effort to help improve the situation while governments and big organisations can make a giant leap to alleviate the problem. In fact, we all should work collectively in different aspects of life to achieve the same goal. Individuals could be environmentally friendly and contribute in their daily lives. Recycling, replacing and reducing are great examples to demonstrate how we can play a part in protecting the planet. In our everyday lives, we can recycle papers, plastic containers, metal cans and so on. Besides, when we are doing shopping for groceries, books or clothes, we could always use reusable bags and buy goods with less unnecessary wrapping. With all these small actions, everyone in the society can make a change to conserve our natural environment. On the other hand, governments and large corporations could work on a higher level to enhance the environment. For example, many governments have imposed plastic bag levy to reduce its use and we can see some efficacy from this move. Also, companies could sell goods with less extra packaging and import fresh produces or goods from sustainable sources. Implementation of new laws by governments could make organisations do businesses in such a way that brings less harm to the planet. In conclusion, I disagree that only governments and huge corporations could make a change to preserve the natural environment. Instead, we should work and contribute together in both daily life, legislative changes and manufacturing processes to achieve environmental conservation.",No,No,Yes,No,No,No,5
It is generally accepted that families are not as close as they used to be. Give some reasons why this change has happened and suggest how families could be brought closer together.,"Nowadays, people’s lifestyle has changed in comparison to the past and family members are not as close as they used to be for several reasons such as the economic issues and the growth of technology. Despite the fact that some would argue that this problem will correct itself overtime, in my view, there is much that can be done to address this problem constructively.

The first reason that families are far from each other these days can be the staggering costs of life which enforce almost all family members to work hard even overtime to provide money and amenities for the family. The rising inflation rate affects all parts of people’s lives and living expenses such as accommodation, either purchasing or renting, eating products, clothes, and other necessities. People, therefore, have to overwork and they cannot find free time spending with their family members in relief. Besides, by the growth of technology, most people tend to spend their time talking to their friends on social media or surfing the internet. So, this keeps people amused and away from their families.

One possible approach would be the government efforts and negotiations in order to hinder the day by day increase in prices; especially the price of dollar which has the significant and direct impact on people’s lives. This would certainly tackle the problem. However, measures like this would be considered as excessive and difficult to be done quickly. A more feasible approach would be time-management in using technology by family members. For instance, family members are to spend their time together after work rather than spending their time on social media or playing games on their gadgets.

In conclusion, it is true that this problem will probably not be solved quickly. However, that is not the reason to avoid taking actions. If the government and people take appropriate actions in this case, this problem will definitely be solved overtime and families could be brought closer together again, I suppose.",Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,7

What are the advantages and disadvantages of extracurricular activities for students?,"In recent years, school systems not only educate students, but also provide a large number of extracurricular activities, which can help students in developing their skills and abilities. However, while it is believed that taking part in such activities can be beneficial in a variety of ways, there are several potential drawbacks that need to be taken into account.

On the one hand, activities outside classroom environtment can bring certain advantages. Firstly, one of the main benefits of doing these activities is that you can improve your soft skills. Organized practical courses give students a chance to exercise and help teach communication skills, problem-solving skills, teamwork and collaboration, all of which are necessary during their grow up and prepare for their future jobs.

Secondly, attending extra activities also play an important role in promoting the mental health. These days, students become increasingly stressed because of overwhelming timetables in the compulsory curriculum. Therefore, students will be relieved pressure of study and feel full of energy when they spend their time on hobby and doing sports.

On the other hand, there are a considerable number of disadvantages. The first one is that being involved in extra curricular activities might be time management. As a result, students might have not enough time to complete their assignment, which fails to meet teachers’ requirements and poor study results.

Another problem is that students can lose their studying motivation in academic program. They may experience some physical difficulties when they participate in such activities. For instance, heavy sport trainings may lead to some health issues. Students who join a sport club may get extremely exhausted and cannot spare enough time for anything else, which effects on academic and creates an imbalance.",No,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5

We can not depend on mechanical instruments instead of ancient method in all diet rules

Physical movement is most important for every one in this modern age, because the people do not walk one metre too. For Instance, they have to do daily two time at least thirty minutes for the suitable heath. For example. they can do this by going to office or school running by-cycles not luxurious vehicles. We can train up our next generation from childhood for everyday playing so that they can aware of their valuable heath. In fact, we should not rely on the virtual world but we should maintain all in practical activities for our precious health.

In conclusion, the fat of the certain country can be removed by the daily practical labour and walking in short range of distances. I recommend, we should not purchase more cars for our ambitious future and the government should apply high tax rate in the price of innovative cars. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6.5
Some people say emotional health is better than physical health. To what extend do you agree,"The wellbeing of people has been since been argued that it is better to be emotionally fit than physical wellness. It is debatable over the years by some people that emotional health fit is of a better choice to physical. i strongly disagree with this essay and my reasons are, emotional wellbeing can mostly be achieved by a physical state of the body. Moreover physical fitness makes us not only emotional healthy but the fitness of the entire self. To begin with, emotional health is mostly achieved by the physical wellbeing. When the body is devoid of any health condition, it is fit and people are able to meet their targets in life. Just like a patient I saw last week in the consulting room who was a musician and very energetic but had an accident that led to surgery and resulted in amputation. Ever since he has been down with one sickness to the other. This ened up with depression and he is currently on antidepressants. Secondly, healthy body makes the other organs medically stable. The patient with one sickness ends up in the hospital and because it is just a low blood pressure he has become depressed, anxious leading to obsession. Example is a bstoke patient is happy and able to walk without support. To conclude, it is argued that emotional health is better than physical fitness and I strongly disagree due to the following two reasons, one needs to be physically stable to have a sound mind. also physical stability will enhance the general health of the person. The two health types in human are all needed and government is advised to encourage all these.",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,5
"Compared to previous generations, an increasing number of people are traveling overseas for holidays. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?","In modern life, more people take trips overseas for pleasure compared to the past. This tendency is increasing all around the globe. The following paragraphs are going to explain the major advantages and disadvantages of the rising trend.

One of the clearest advantages here is that it gives people the opportunity to experience different cultures and customs, giving a broader perspective of the world. By visiting other countries, people become more understanding and tolerant of other cultures, and can learn to appreciate the cultural differences that exist. There are also benefits for the holiday itself, as many people tend to holiday in destinations that have better weather. For example, citizens of countries where the number of sunny hours is limited can rip benefit from abundance of sunshine in hot countries enriching their body with vitamin D.

However, there are disadvantages for the country, as citizens are spending their money overseas rather than in the domestic market. By taking holiday at home, people can not only economize in their budget but also play a role in the development of tourism in their own country. However, this is negated by the fact that although people leave their own country for a holiday, other people visit their country for the same reason. In New Zealand, for example, money spent overseas by people leaving the country is replaced by those who visit the country for their holiday.

To conclude, ubiquitous advances in technology have given the consumer more choice in overseas holidays. Although there are negative ramifications of people’s having their holidays in foreign countries, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.",Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6.5
Underground is the most efficient mode of transportation,"Nowadays, underground is the most effective mode of transportation. l completely agree with this idea.

The reason why l hold view is that underground is cheaper and more affordable than other transports. That is because, nowadays, students use underground when they go to school, a lot of people use underground when they go to their work. In other words, people use less buses and automobiles. At a result, people use underground a lot.

My second reason is that underground is very fast. That is because people get to place early, when they go to commute. Underground goes one station for 3 minutes in Baku.

Taking everything into account, l agree that underground is the most useful mode of transportation. It affects a lot our life.",No,No,No,No,No,No,5.5

One of the clearest advantages here is that it gives people the opportunity to improve their language skills, broaden outlook. By moving other countries, people become tolerant and more understanding of other cultures, can learn to appreciate the cultural differences. People learn new culture and regard it. There are also benefits for living in foreign countries, as some people tend to get higher education in other countries. For example, Azerbaijan people move to foreign countries for get higher education and make their career. However, there are disadvantages for people, as people who leave for other countries are missing their family and relatives. Also, people have language barrier and face difficulties when improve their language skills. People adapt to new environment and forget previous environment. This is negated by the fact that although people leave their own country for living, other people leave their country for the same reason.

There is no denying the fact that money plays a crucial role in our lives. Children are too young to...,"It is believed by most parents that teaching the importance of money to children at a young age is necessary. I completely agree with that view and will give my opinion in the following paragraphs.

On the one hand, most kids today often do not understand the value of money. This often comes from their families, some parents think that children are too young to understand about money, or some are too busy to teach them. Thus, children will tend to be wasteful, looking down on some things or some kind of people. For instance, most children immediately want a toy or food as soon as they see it and they throw angry if their desire is not fulfilled. They do not care if the parents have the resources to buy them what they want, in some cases when they are not met by their parents, it also leads to negative actions. It is necessary to teach they know how much hard work goes into earning each penny. Only then they would appreciate the things which they have.

On the other hand, children also need to be taught the wisdom of handling money. Therefore, they will not be deceived by bad intentions, nor will they suffer financial crisis in their adulthood. Families need to teach them how to save and manage money well. For example, parents should assign household chores to their children and reward them when finished. Hence, kids will respect what they do, work harder and try to save. Just like that, in the future they will become independent people and often wise against bad temptations.

To summarize, it is essential to teach children about the value of money from an early age. That brings so many good benefits to their future.",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,5.5

"Some people prefer to take vacations in quiet, natural places, while others prefer to spend their vacation time in big cities. Compare and contrast these two types of vacation. Then indicate which you prefer and why","Some individuals would rather have holiday time in natural settings which is calm and peaceful whereas others tend to spend their break in an active place. There are two types of tourism that everyone wonders about were deciding to spend their time in. In my perspective, I would prefer to take vacation time in natural areas to make the most of my time. However, spending in natural places or in large cities has both several differences and some similarities and I will show up personal opinion in my own essay.

To begin with, the biggest difference between the two forms of tourism is price. As many of you already know, the expenses that happen in big cities are always on the high side when compared to within natural habitats. We spend a huge of money in working out our flights, accommodations, meals, and sightseeing within our budget while we can enjoy our holiday in rural areas with reasonable expenses and maybe half as low as another.

Another distinction between where we travel is the environment. From my personal experience, a dose of fresh air in natural areas is always better than in crowed cities, natural areas have not been influenced by industry and modernization, or have overpopulation, issues such as contaminated air, traffic congestion, and industrial waste are infrequent. On the other hand, the gas emission or the using fertilizers and herbicides of the chemical factories have impacted human life and tourists who are visiting these areas.

Besides the several differences, these two of types tourism have significant similarities in some aspects. Traveling in urban or in a place that belongs to nature is a form of entertainment, it enables each individual to release peer pressure after being hard-working and enjoy the quality of life. It provides broader our ideas and broadens our horizons and brings our optimistic view of precious life.

To sum up, when we compare and contrast about taking a holiday in natural places or in big cities, we can uncomplicated see differences and similarities about of them. Each form will have distinct qualities and we should take consideration to get the best suitable decision for ourselves, it must depend on each person’s hobby, demand, and situation.",No,No,No,No,No,No,5.5
Smoking is injurious to health and its addiction and serious health reactions have increased into an alarming level in today’s world. I strongly agree to the opinion of its prohibition.,"Firstly, we all know that cigarettes and other tobacco products are very dangerous for all human beings. Even its manufacturers label on it that “cigarette smoking can kill you” or “it is not good for your health”. Likewise, once I saw a cigarette packet, it clearly had a label mentioning “smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer”. So even the manufactures are bound to inform his users that these are highly injurious to their health.

Secondly, in today’s world we are suffering from a pandemic caused by Coronavirus and other poor atmospheric issues i. e. smog. We have a lot of suffering going on because of these illnesses in our surroundings which is damaging our lungs so in any case cigarettes and other tobacco products will cause disastrous effects to one’s health. For instance, I had an uncle who was a chain smoker. We lost him in a pandemic because his lungs were already affected due to this bad habit. Sadly, his lung could not restrain the burden of Covid.

Although, all people know it’s killing effects but still its consumption is increasing, so to protect everyone's health the government should completely ban production of such products. However, the tobacco industry and its users will oppose this opinion but the government should appreciate them to cooperate and understand the long term benefits of human health. Government should appreciate the production of such alternative products which can be used instead of cigarettes and other tobacco stuff. For example tobacco flavor spray or chewing gum which can be used to fulfill your smoking desire without affecting your health.

In a nutshell, it is extremely beneficial for the public health if the government restricts the production of tobacco products. ",No,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5

Furthermore, youngsters will be hanging their Christmas stockings in the hopes of receiving some nice presents from Santa Claus. Everyone goes to church after supper and prays to God, admitting their faults and afflictions, as well as their wishes for health and happiness. On Christmas Eve, many schools and businesses are closed so that family may spend time together. The most well-known icon is Santa Claus, an elderly guy with long white hair, a beard, and a red cloak who is trusted by children to bring us gifts at Christmas. // Perhaps one of the most significant holidays is Christmas, when everyone comes together and relaxes after a year of hard work.

Do you agree or disagree with a statement that people should only focus on developing their Strengths but not improving their Weaknesses?,"It is a common belief that people should only focus on establishing their strengths and not on improving their weaknesses.

However, I firmly believe that improving both the weak and the prosperity is extremely beneficial. Improve yourself to become the most perfect version.

On the one hand, you should focus on developing your strengths, to make them more confident. Developing strengths improves many aspects both physically and mentally. When we have developed ourselves, we will have more relationships, we will have more motivation in life. From there, we will have clear goals for ourselves and life will become more meaningful. A study from 2016 found when we focus on developing our strengths, we grow faster than when trying to improve our weaknesses.

On the other hand, weakness is what makes us feel fear so this is something we should develop. Improving our weaknesses helps us no longer feel shy but more confident anytime, anywhere. This weakness can also become your strength. But we need more time and effort to improve it and never give up to be able to develop more ourselves.

In short, many people have the opinion that only focusing on improving strengths. We should balance the time to develop both our weaknesses to make us more perfect and free from fear.",No,No,No,No,No,No,5.5
Cultures around the world becoming more and more similar,"It is said that in today's globalized world cultures and traditions are indistinguishable to compare to last decades. This essay will discuss the main causes why people face to similarity are of influence wastern culture and give some possible development to this. To my mind, this have more negative outweigh positive.

First of all, in this day and age advertisement are ubiquitous and play pivotal role in promoting latest trend and fashion followed by some developed countries. Many developing cultures people trying to adapt to the modern culture whether what it is about food, clothes and music. Furthemore, in social media sites especially young generations have common interests about music and they may immatiate to their fans with a lot of ways such as they reply to dance on behind tiktok dancers, girls who like to follow follow models are tend to make up their face, change their styles to look like like a kind of puppet or some open clothes attract more and more young people that it is seen as an image of modernity Personally i believe that this does not conform to the custom of some eastern peoples or some individuals argue that distorts the behaviour of the people

Secondly, It is true that when people travel to abroad, it is comforting to use leisure amenities, people can eat in their favourite food no matter where this produced and listen some kind of music such as English music popular with everyone. Besides, this helps also economy of nation as international industry development and attracts more tourists.

"Nowadays, in some countries, people are spending long hours at the workplace? Why does this happen? Is this a negative or positive trend?","Nowadays, many people are overworked due to pressure from work and daily necessities. It is obvious that modernized life leads to an increasing cost of living, people have to work overtime to make ends meet. For example, parents need to work extra hours to earn more than their base salary to afford electricity bills, their children’s tuition fees, . . . . Especially since the Covid-19 pandemic, parents have to prepare computers or smartphones for their kids to study from home. In some other cases, many young people choose to work overtime with the desire to have opportunities for career advancement. The proof that an employee is willing to stay for another few hours at work can be perceived as a sign of one's serious commitment to the job. Employers usually look for people who are hard-working and long-term. So spending more time at work can lead to promotion prospects, higher salaries and career status.

However, overwork can present many problems, the most significant of which is that it can damage employees' health. When we spend too many hours on working, it is more likely that we cannot find time and energy left to take care of ourselves properly such as participating in outdoor activities, maintaining a balanced diet or getting enough sleep. As a result, overtime can cause stress, burnout, and depression. For example, Japan has the highest rate of suicide among workers, mostly men, in the world due to overwhelming work pressure. Besides, working long hours leaves them little time to spend with their friends and families. They are less likely to achieve work-life balance and will risk the well-being of their close relationships, exposing them to isolation in the future.",No,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5
The bar chart shows expenditure on companies,"The chart provides information about three car companies in the UK which are Acura, Chevrolet, and Cadillac spent on three types of advertising in 2007.

Overall. we can see that while Cadillac spent most of its money on advertising, the money for advertising in Acura was a little bit lower. It is noticeable that the spending of Acura and Chevrolet was nearly similar.

Regarding TV, Cadillac invested the most in it, with a vast majority (70 million dollars), followed by Chevrolet and Acura with 60 million dollars and 55 million dollars in turn. The gap between companies was not really a big difference, just about a tenth percent. This pattern can be seen again with the press, with 55 million dollars in Cadillac then 40 million dollars for Chevrolet. The spent on the press in Acura is slightly less than the other two companies, which is 39 million dollars.

These days it is much easier for many people to travel to different countries for tourism than in the past,"In the recent decades, there has been a significant increase in the number of opportunities for international tourism. In my opinion, with the growth in international tourism, people now have a greater awareness of other cultures than in the past, while the benefits of this trend can be outweighed by the drawbacks.

On the one hand, the main benefit that people derive from the international tourism when it becomes easy is that it improves global mindset of those, because travelling widely can give them the chance to enjoy such things as the art, customs and cuisine of different countries and to meet other people who have different cultural backgrounds. This makes them well-informed enough about every aspect of the life.

There are, however, far more drawbacks associated with the growth of international tourism. The first one is that if many more tourists visit a country, the culture and environment of that place are more likely to be damaged. For example, traditional crafts are replaced by the cheap trinkets, which may make them eventually disappear. Also, a greater number of tourists stay for only a short period of time, but they tend to litter the streets. Because of that, tourism is often considered as one of the key factors contributing to the pollution in some areas, where tourism industry is well developed.

Finally, although the hospitality industry can create employment for local people, it tends to be precarious because much of it is seasonal, with long periods of the year offering no work. As a result, most people having a job related to the tourism industry often need to look for work or even suffer from poverty in other seasons of the year when fewer visitors come.

In conclusion, there are some advantages of travel, but these do not compensate for the damage inflicted on the environment, culture and individuals by mass tourism.",No,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5
The Effect of Heat Input of GTAW Process on the Microstructure of the Heat Affected Zone in AISI D2 tool steel,"AISI D2 is the most commonly used high-carbon and high-chromium cold-work tool steel. It has many attractive properties such as high wear resistance, high compressive strength, and high hardness after hardening which can be an advantage for a variety of industrial applications such as mill rolls, blanking dies, and punches. The steels of this group are considered as the most alloy steels [1]. Although these steels have the same chemical composition as stainless steels because of their high chromium contents they are prone to corrosion cause of the lower percentage of nickel than stainless steels[2]. Furthermore, they have higher hardness compared to stainless steel given their high percentage of carbon [1]. These steels are usually subject to heavy loads and abrasion. Surface defects because of wear, corrosion, and other degradation mechanisms will make these expensive tools leave the production cycle and impose heavy costs on industries. These steels obtain desirable abrasion properties from the presence of large values of carbon, chromium, and other alloying elements such as vanadium and molybdenum. however, the existence of these alloying elements in steel increases the hardness because of carbide formation that besides the advantages makes this steel weak in welding. The existence of large-scale cold cracks for these steels and the loss of dimensional accuracy are among the reported problems in welding parts made of this type of steel [3]. Preheating is necessary for welding these steels and it causes of reduces the thermal gradient between the weld zone and the heat affected zone, thereby reducing cracking, hardness and residual stresses in the HAZ are affected by reducing the cooling rate. Moreover, it prevents high heat shock due to welding [4]. Input heat is one of the most important welding parameters and the most effective element on the width and coarseness of the HAZ. Any change in this factor directly affects the HAZ. The input heat affects the grain growth in the area near the melting line. Moreover, the structure of the grains affects the strength, toughness, flexibility, and corrosion resistance of the alloy. Welding leads to internal stresses in the part that can be destructive and have adverse effects on the performance of the part. These internal stresses could result in warping, cracking (dimensional distortion), and even breaking of the part at stresses much lower than the stresses that the part is designed to withstand. PWHT increases the life of the part and its strength by eliminating or reducing internal stresses and reducing stiffness [5]. Thus, a correct understanding of the effects of input heat on the microstructure and properties of welded specimens is important. By observing the principles of heat treatment and performing pre-heating and post-heat at the proper temperature and welding with controlled heat and precise control of all welding parameters and variables, a good weld can be reached.

"Memorization of information by frequent repetition, namely Rote learning play a role in many education","There are three ingredients in the good life learning, earning and yearning. Some people believe that acquire knowledge through cramming is essential in a plethora of academies. But, others thought that meaningful understanding is crucial as compared with rote learning. Both arguments have their own pros and cons and I shall discuss my view points in upcoming paragraphs.

To begin with, first and foremost reason is that with the help of rote studying people can easily gain cognizance. Secondly, individuals can learn things through grasping such as pupils remember a script of play and recollect the mobile number. Finally, youngsters cram physics equations, mathematics formulas because it is illogical to study these type of definitions bye heart. Some juveniles use cramming to learn exams.

On the other hand, every garden has weeds. Firstly, teenagers never use rote learning for longer terms. Secondly, if children do not recall the things again and again then infants f forget whole material. Lastly, communities never utilize rote learning in some situations because when people cram all the data mixed in mind and people get confused.

Probing ahead with meaningful understanding, teenagers who understand the whole information they never forget in lifetime. Moreover, meaningful learning is a must if a person want to achieve something in life. In addition, education system prefer both ways of teaching.

To sum up, I would like to reiterate that due to the rote learning societies forget things if they never recall. However, meaningful knowledge is important because with these humans can use for long time.",No,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5
"Some say that sports play an important role in society. Others, however, think that it is nothing more than a leisure activity.","Some would argue that playing sport is simply an activity that people do as an exercise, while others believe that sport has a significant effect on society and people’s life. While training and playing sport can merely leisure, but I assume that sport does have an important function in society.

On the one hand, nobody can deny that sport is a great leisure activity. The majority of people all around the world participate in sporting activities every day because of the sense of well-being and relaxation that it brings them. People play sport for numerous reasons, including, wanting to get fit or stay in shape, as a way to take their mind off the stress of daily life. For instance, my wife has a regular plan to go to the gym to do exercise because she has a stressful job and this kind of activities help her to decline the stress. I believe that sport plays a vital role at present in society in comparison with relaxation and getting fit.

On the other hand, the sport has so many advantages and It does serve a number of usual functions within society. Sport creates healthier societies. People who play sport are known to be happier and healthier, and less prone to certain mental and physical illness, which reduces the burdens on healthcare systems. Sport also brings people together and creates a sense of unity within societies. This can be witnessed when complete strangers join together to cheer on and support their countries football team. For example, in my own country, whenever our national football team plays with another country, men, women and children get together to support our team and give them a positive sense. I presume that sport has a crucial function and position in societies.

To elaborate, thesdays, people use washing machines and other machines in their homes which are helpful time consuming. In companies and industries all work by machines because machines are done work within less hours. On the flip side using of machines has numerous of negative effects on society and people.

There is an increasing trend for people to live alone. What is causing this to happen? Will it have a negative or a positive impact on the society?,"The extraordinary rise of living alone is among the most significant social trends of the modern world. Living alone is ubiquitous in developed, open societies, and this particularly affects health and health care. In my opinion, experiencing one has a negative impact on society.

One possibility is that there is a causal link between living alone, being socially isolated, and feeling lonely. But these are three distinct conditions, and living alone does not necessarily mean experiencing one or both of the others (being isolated or feeling lonely). Overall, the main cause of living alone is the tendency of life, nowadays, people do not get married any more than before. Secondly, individuals often spend more time studying and working, especially in civic. Research shows that Americans who are working as journalists, scholars, health care providers, and business persons usually conflate living alone, feeling lonely, and being isolated, and the result is widespread confusion about each condition.

In more detail, living alone is the consequence of isolation because of physical frailty as well as deaths in their family and friendship networks. Thus, they have smaller social networks and less stable contact with children, and they face heightened risks of isolation if they divorce or become widowers.

The risks of social isolation depend not only on which kind of people, but also on the place people are living. Poor neighborhoods with a robust social infrastructure, busy sidewalks, and these social infrastructures suffered higher mortality rates.

At these points, most policy recommendations for reducing living alone are essential. As the population ages and the number of people aging alone grows, societies throughout the world will need to develop new supportive housing programs and new forms of elderly care.",Yes,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5
"Task 2 It is sometimes said that people should be encouraged to get married before they are 30, as this is the best both for the individual and for society. Do you agree or disagree ?","Marriage is an undeniable needs for both male and female. By bonding together for lifetime at suitable age it is blatant truth that society can also get benefit from the couple if the relationship between husband and wife is healthy. I agree with the statement.

To start with the positive side of the essay it is clear that every single thing has it’s proper time. Now a days people are so busy with their carrier they have not that much time to think about the future life partner. They had relations for passing time as I could say they are in live-in to fulfill physical needs which is harmful for the society. Ethics are rarely found in the character of any person in the present world. When they realized their mistak, there will be no time to fixed it up. Late marriage brings them think that their children will grown up late. They haven’t any time to spend quality time with their parents; sons and daughter are so busy with their daily life and going to do the same mistake. Furthermore, parents can't ask any questions to their children which put them in guilty situation.

With respect to marriage and better half, a marriage can be positively set an example for the society. By sharing the same bond with love and support can bring happiness. People are wise enough at the age of 30 that they can make their own decision. By getting marriage sense of responsibility has grown in the personality which can’t be seen any other relations.

In the view to aforementioned facts and circumstances, I opine that getting marriage in a proper age can have some challenges but it should be bear in mind that nothing is impossible if there is a reliable person beside you who can support you either be a judgemental one. ",No,No,No,No,No,No,5.5

The upcoming paragraphs will analyze some explanations for this situation as well as its influence on the society.

There can be two crucial factors that contribute to the popular disinterest in science as a subject. To commence with, science subjects often require a lot of hard work and patience to score average grades, having such patience may prove challenging for many, especially when most of the non science students are indulged in leisure activities. Furthermore, employment opportunities science field has is limited and extremely competitive. For example, after devoting five years in graduation, there is a need to specialize further in some particular science subject to get good and highly paid job. This may discourage many students and thereby it may refrain the students from choosing science as their preferred subject.

Consequently, the results are manifold of this aforesaid trend, as, if there is no admission in science subject, there will be a scarcity of human resources in science field. For example, if there is no one studying science, there will be a deficiency of expert medical practitioners or surgeons; this could create an imbalance in the society. Moreover, if there is no new practitioners or scientists formed, there will be an adding of pressure on the current practitioners and this is not a very favorable condition for the society.

To recapitulate, I would reckon that, extended hard work and study pressure is making students alienated from science subjects, this trend can create serious imbalances in the contemporary society. ",Yes,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5
Genetic engineering is an important issue in modern society. Some people think that it will improve people's lives in many ways. Others feel that it may be a threat to life on earth. Discuss both opinions and give your opinion?,"It is true that genetic engineering is a key area of modern scientific research, with broad implications for all human societies. While I accept that this field of technology may have its dangers, I believe that the benefits of genetic engineering outweigh the drawbacks.

The negative implications of genetic engineering are often discussed in terms of two key areas, which are food production and the cloning of humans. Genetically modified crops are already being grown, and people are concerned that they may damage whole ecosystems as foods become resistant to diseases and natural predators. But perhaps even more worrying is the possibility that humans could be modified or cloned. Some people imagine a world in which cloned humans are used to fight wars or to provide body part replacements. Although perhaps not a threat to life on earth, the implications of such practices would be unprecedented.

A more optimistic prediction, and one that I favour, is that humans will find ways to mitigate the risks and use genetic technologies in a responsible way. From the food production perspective, genetic engineering could be the solution to famine in developing countries, if, for instance, crops can be grown more reliably in harsh conditions. From a medical perspective, scientists may use genetic engineering to produce vaccines, to cure diseases, or to correct a genetic defect before a child is born. If properly regulated, even cloning can be done in a way that improves lives. For example, the cloning of individual organs, such as a heart or kidney, could be permitted for transplant purposes.

In conclusion, I am convinced that genetic engineering will have a positive impact on our lives, and that people's fears will be unwarranted",No,No,No,No,No,No,5.5
Write about the following topic: Some people advocate the death penalty for those who committed violent crimes. Others say that capital punishment is unacceptable in contemporary society.Describe the advantages and disadvantages of the death penalty and give your opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"The rate of violence is increasing day by day in our society. It is creating several bad impacts on our youth, and on the next generations too. Therefore, a rule of death penalty has been set for committing any crime. Couple of people agree with the notion that a punish of death as a result of any violence is a great step. While, several people think that providing a death penalty to a criminal is unbearable. In my opinion, committing a sin should be prohibited by punishing the criminal.

Nowadays, many of scandals have been rushed out in our society. This may includes robbery, cutting pockets, rapes, killing an innocence etc. The main reason behind all these sins are lack of education as well as not getting punished of what crime has been committed. Therefore, the criminal have no fear while heading to any type of sin. Advocating a strict punishment would be a right step to end such types of crimes in our society. The main primacy of this will be the end of every type of crimes. There would be a fear of punishment in everyone's mind so no one will have guts to commit a sin. There are instances where these criminals who have been sentenced to life imprisonment escape from prison and end up in society where they continue to commit their violence.

Similarly, death penalty can lead to several drawbacks as well. Capital punishment should be discouraged because of the fact, that sometimes certain crimes are committed on impulse. Let’s take the case of a person who murders someone on impulse and instantly regrets his action. Maybe he committed the murder in a state of anger or some other strong emotion. While it is totally true that the person has committed murder and deserves to be punished seriously for his crime, it is sometimes too harsh to give such a person the death sentence considering the fact that the murder wasn’t planned. Unfortunately, in many places where the death penalty is practiced, a capital offence, whether it was committed on impulse or not, warrants a death sentence. ",No,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5
Novels and television dramas are a reflection of the society in general.,"Novels and television dramas are a reflection of the society in general. What is shown in dramas is similar to what actually happens in our society. In most of the countries today, crime novels and TV dramas related to crime are becoming common and, individuals are adoring these types of shows and books. In my opinion, this is not a positive development for the society as dramas and books can be an effective medium to sway the mind-set of the people.

TV shows and books are a great source of entertainment and the favourite pastime of general public. In recent times series and books related to crime are gaining more and more popularity.

The primary reason for this is that they involve such stories or characters which influence the audience. Moreover, people start relating their life to this type of entertainments. Crime novels and books involve nudity, violence and robbery which people think will refresh them after a long day at work.

However, crime related series or books contain content which is strictly targeted at a selected audience. This type of shows cannot be watched with the entire family. Also, some people may get inspired by such shows and enact the same in their life. Unfortunately, this can have disastrous consequences for them and the society.

To conclude, production houses or writers should create such type of stories which have a beneficial effect on the society. They need to understand that their work influences the masses and hence they should produce stories and movies which have a reformatory effect on the society. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6
"Society is based on rules and laws. If individuals were free to do whatever they want to do, it could not function. To what extent do you agree or disagree with the above statement?","The laws and rules make a society complete. If people are set free to do whatever they want to do then it won't function, so there needs to rules and laws which individuals need to follow to make a society stronger.

I understand that every society wants to form rules and laws, and which the superiors think that needs to be followed in order to make things work in the right and ethical way, but i personaly don't agree on the point because from my experience and point of view, I believe that we humans are born to be free and wild, and the more someone tries to control us, the more we lose control, or go in depression from the pressure of peers.

There are many researches which has shown the relatonship between the human's desire to do something when they are set free, and while they are bounded. When someone feels stressed due to the boundries created by other people then the person is not able to put much focus and interest on that particular thing. For instance, if there was a rule made by society that every person had to choose engeeniering or to be a doctor then how creativity would emerge? What i mean to say is that if a person is not allowed to think out of the box then there is no way the creativity will increase among individuals.

Furthermore, I would say that rules and laws isn't what makes a society functioning, but the freedom to do what people love and desire, and be accepted for that. People who follow their heart has always been threat to the society. Especialy the society full of insecure and iggnorant people.

In conclusion, some people believe that society is only functioning when people follow rules and laws, and not set free to follow their heart which i donot agree on as we humans are born to be free and wild. We humans are not birds, or like other animals that can be kept in cages. Creativity emerges when we let people explore their mind. ",Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,6
There is an increasing trend for people to live alone. What is causing this to happen? Will it have a negative or a positive impact on the society?,"The extraordinary rise of living alone is among the most significant social trends of the modern world. In my opinion, experiencing alone has an adverse impact on society, and urbanization is one of the important reasons for the rising living alone tendency.

One possibility is that there is a causal link between living alone, being socially isolated, and feeling lonely. Overall, the original cause of living alone is the tendency of life, nowadays, people do not get married any more than previously. Because individuals frequently spend more time studying and working, especially in civic. For example, individuals, the research shows that Americans who are working as journalists, scholars, health care providers, and business managers usually conflate living alone, feeling lonely, and being isolated, and this result is widespread confusion about each condition.

In more detail, urbanization is the consequence of living alone tendency because of social frailty in relationships. There are many more new relationships in a lifetime day, and with the assistance of technology, people are not usually making any effort to directly interact together. Thus, they can’t hold on to the social network well and facing the heightened risks of isolation. Moreover, this giving more negative consequences for people who divorce or become widowers, and without close-knit family relationships. The risk of living alone is that not only negatively affecting the physical and mental health but also suffering higher mortality rate.

In conclusion, urbanization is the main cause of rising living alone. It has negative impacts on social relationships and increases health and mental illnesses. At these points, most policy recommendations for reducing living alone are essentials. ",Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6.5
The government should control the amount of violence in films and on television in order to decrease the violent crimes in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is irrefutable that the films and TV programmes today are filled with violence and as a

result violence is increasing in our societies. I agree that censoring such programmes and

films, some amount of violence can be decreased. In the following paragraphs, I shall put

forth my arguments to support my views.

Reducing the amount of violence on TV and in the cinema would certainly be a good start to

decrease violence among people. It is a well known fact that the media possesses a lot of

power to influence people. So, those in the media must be judicious about delivering news

in a balanced manner that brings the story to the consumer without showing too much

violence. Journalism is a profession like any other and certain standards of quality and

professionalism need to be maintained.

There are many harmful effects of such programmes on the individuals and society. The

most disturbing effect is on the children and youth. Media violence can stimulate fear in

some children as it frightens them, making the effects long lasting. This can become

traumatic in our children as they see it more and more. Children are starting to grow and

are shaping their personality, values and beliefs. They can become aggressive or they can

lose a sense of reality and fiction of what they are seeing.

Moreover, young people imitate what they see and it is logical that they see glamour in

what they do when they commit violence. Consequently, the society suffers as the streets

are full of violence. Finally, too much portrayal of these also leads to immunity among the

people and they are not affected by the disasters any more. Disasters like Tsunami and

earthquakes don’t make people shed a tear any more.

To put it in a nutshell, I pen down saying that, having a check on the violence in TV

programmes and films, would certainly be a good start to decrease the violence and crime

in society. ",No,No,No,No,No,No,5.5
"By punishing murderer with the death penalty, society it also guilty of committing murder. Therefore, life in prison it a better punishment for murderers. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","In this given statement about whether using death penalty or life in prison metod is more effectively. I completely stand under the answer of life in prison, because i reckon that it brings greater advantage to the society.

Preliminary, Punishment is method which society utilizes to restrict and mitigate murderer’s actions. If a murderer commits a crime, it is the best option from my standpoint is using punishment method, because this method allows him to understand his own guilt. Punishment types are vary from each other according to kind of crime, which murderers commit. This topic is very challengeable because this causes the two contrasting opinions.

The first group of people who in favor of death penalty, have their own reasons for their opinion. They say that nothing compensate life, so any form of punishment will not be adequate or fair. This kind of punishment can not

bring back to life. ",No,No,No,No,No,No,5.5
"By punishing murderer with the death penalty, society it also guilty of committing murder. Therefore, life in prison it a better punishment for murderers. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","Punishment is the weapon which society uses to limit and reduce murders’ actions. Punishment type and toughness are different according to the types of crime or action. The most serious crime, which is killing a person with previous planning, leads the murderer to the death penalty after making sure that he/she is the killer through clear proofs. This essay tackles and discusses two contrasting opinions. The first party believes that death penalty is essential and fair enough for killers. Whereas others see that it is fighting badness by badness and that does not generate good and balanced society.

The first group of people who are pro penalty death have their own logical reasons for their opinion. They say that nothing is equal to life but life itself. So any other form of punishment will not be sufficient or fair. A human body is a unique private property and if somebody causes damage to it or destroys it, he/she must have the same damage. In addition to that making penalty extremely harsh is considered as an effective alarm or red light to whoever may think about committing crimes. Therefore the main aim of penalty will be achieved by reducing crime rates especially killing crimes which have bad results without sufficient compensate.

On the other hand, there are many people who believe that death penalty is not the best punishment they say that death of criminal or murder will not make the victim return to life. So it is not perfect compensate for victim’s relatives. Although it seems that by killing murder the balance of society will be return, some experts believe that it will raise violence in the society. As a result, they recommend that life in prison sentence is better. That penalty makes killer think always about his crime. It is also lifelong mental punishment when he/she finds other prisons finish their sentences while he/she stash for the rest of his/her life.

Finally, I agree with the first party because of the same reason which I have mentioned previously. Also, that opinion fits my religious belief as Muslim. ",No,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5
The number of older people is increasing Some people think that this will cause problems in their countries others believe this group is important to society Discuss both views and give your own opinion,"With the availability of good medical treatment, the life expectancy of elderly people has increased. Many opine that this may lead to financial pressure for the government whereas others argue that having more old people will help the society to grow morally. I believe senior citizens have an important role to play to mold the next generation into becoming a better and responsible individual.

As technology advances, the medical field can increase the total life expectancy in humans. This has helped to increase the survival rate of old people. For some, this scenario has built up financial stress in the healthcare system. As, a huge amount of budget goes into treating these elderly patients, who according to them do not contribute anything to society. So, they think that instead of allotting a huge budget for a senior citizen that amount should be spent on other important things like education or child care facilities. However, it is the responsibility of the government to help with the treatment of old people as they were once taxpayers to the nation, and have already contributed their part to society.

On the other hand, many people think that having elders in society can help to impart moral values to the children. As, children are the future generation of a country, helping them to grow into better individuals is of utmost importance. Apart from that, as most of the old people are retired, they can help to look after their grandkids. Nowadays, both the parents have to work full time in order to meet both ends, grandparents are the best option to have as a caretaker. They can also help to impart the family and social values in them. In India, the majority of kids are raised by their grandparents, and they have shown to grow up into a lot of adjusting individuals.

In conclusion, saying that elders are the problem to the healthcare budget is totally illogical. They have done their part by paying taxes when they had to. Rather older people are an asset to every nation, as they can help the future generation to become a good person, by sharing valuable knowledge.",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,5

Gathering is a part and parcel for lonely people.

Although, some people trust that moving on these festivity is only to misuse money and show off however, on the other hand, we adopt that style to discourage our poor relatives that they might not be able to attend our high society parties.

Today people are living in a throwaway society where they use things for a short time only and then throw them away. What are the causes of this and what problems can it lead to?,"Nowadays, it is increasingly common for people to buy new things frequently. Unfortunately, this also encourages them to throw away old but usable things. This trend has a negative effect on the environment.

People are inclined to buy new things mainly because of the irresistible advertisements. Manufacturers promote their new products rigorously and capitalize on the needs and wants of people. For instance, every year companies launch a new model of smart phones. Even though it would have the same functionality as the previous model, people are attracted by the promotions and buy it. Another reason for this compulsive urge to buy is the busy lifestyle of people. Nobody has time to fix things that have stopped working. Actually, buying new stuff is easier than getting things repaired.

Admittedly, this trend has become a serious threat to our environment. Excessive production of goods leads to the depletion of natural resources. For instance, many trees are cut down to produce various household items. If people wanted to replace their furniture more frequently, it would result in destruction of forests. In addition, when products are thrown away, they produce more garbage. Many consumer goods have non-recyclable parts that will remain in the soil forever. Thus by throwing away goods we are unwittingly causing damage to the environment.

To conclude, the throwaway culture is a reflection of our materialistic mentality. We have little regard for nature or natural resources. However, considering the destruction it would cause to the environment, this practice needs to be curtailed / discouraged. The government should launch campaigns to create awareness about the dangers of throwing away goods and also enact laws that make recycling mandatory.",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,5.5
The current interest in famous people’s private lives has negative effects both for those people and for society as a whole. Newspapers should not be allowed to publish details of people’s private lives unless it is clearly in the public interest.

Some say it should get publish and others like me disagree with it that it should not be on newspaper until its not between public.

Begin with, getting to know about someone's private life and a person who is famous is a trending topic. But don't get that a person or you can celebrity life gets affected and it will make them feel irritated because once they get out from their house all their fans standing outside to see a person and gets picture with them. Now after this journalist comes they click their photos and put it between public. For example, a celebrity is travelling abroad for vacation with his/her family and journalist will click a picture will write a celebrity is travelling abroad with his family and all the details about them. It should not be allowed to post or write all the details about a person it's his private life. But if, a person from himself allowing to do that then it is different.

On the other hand, job done by journalist will give fame to a celebrity and it will make them to grow even more higher but sometimes celebrity gets irritated because of his mood maybe by doing this he/she may get defame and public will not like them and their carrier must be in trouble by doing this they will become their own enemy and can trouble in future. it can lead to a person depression, axniety and many more. for example if one gets depression and he commit sucide the fans of a particular will broke and can take any step which can affect community.

As per my knowledge, people should not get in someone's personal life if its a normal person or a celebrity it will make someone's life disturbing and journalist also should not post things until its not between public.

International sports events like Olympics is necessary to raise patriotic emotions among the society,"Every four years, the whole world stops to watch international sporting events such as the Olympics and the Football World Cup in which athletes show their best performance to make their country proud. These sporting occasions have proved to be helpful in easing international tension in difficult times when powerful leaders were trying to control the world’s economy and other governments were fighting over the land. The Olympic Games are one of the best examples which prove how sporting events can bring nations together, at least temporarily. From the ancient History, when Greeks and Romans would interrupt battles to participate in the games, to the more recent international disputes, when athletes from Palestine and Israel would forget their differences, compete peacefully and even embrace each other after an event. Moreover, these popular events have called the world’s attention to the terrible consequences of wars; thus some leaders have tried to reach agreements to end their disputes and live peacefully.

Similarly, international sporting events show benefits in some developing countries which live in a daily internal civil war. For example, Brazil has a high rate of unemployment, lack of education, hunger, crime, poverty and corruption which leads to an immense embarrassment of being Brazilian and a low self-esteem. However, when the Football World Cup starts, the Brazilian squad, which is considered the best team in the world, provokes an amazing feeling of pride in their country. Most people seem to forget all their problems and even the criminal activity decreases. They paint roads with the national colors, wear the Brazilian team shirts and buy national flags.

It is believed by a plethora of people that no one can continue job forever, whereas other individuals argue that to be in same job is advantageous for person; however, in my opinion if human feels growth or satisfaction it's beneficial to be in the workplace. This essay will discuss both of aforementioned view.

To commence with, few people argue to be in same profession or career. If someoneis following the same profession or a job, then it will be easier to attain perfection in his field.

On the other hand, why nobody should continue same job forever? . The reason behind this is fixed job will bound your limits the field. Change in employment will increase the money, but, also the gain knowledge. Though if, one had changed placement, the changein environment would have given more exposure and challenges. Which can increase productivity. For example, the research conducted by Harvard University in 2015 that 70% of people is glad to change their employment. Owing to the fact that, it gives them new experiences and got increased salary. Thus, changing job will benefit society and industry to have satisfied and trained employees.

This essay shed light on both perceptions but also my point of view will be elaborated in conclusion. To commence with first notion, there are myraid things to be shared in its favour. First of all, in this present era, people depend upon automated machines because it reduce the dependence on physical labour, through robots everything is possible to do. Moreover, it is used inside the bodies for monitoring the health. For instance, The times of India was conducted a survey and analysed the that all over the world out of 1000, 88% people are depend on Mach in the hospitals. Thus it shows that robots are more beneficial in all sectors like in Industry, banking and in the health sector. Moving towards the second argument of the debate, the first point of this issue is that, robots will replace human because of this unemployment will increase. As a consequences many problems will occur such as poverty. Apart from this, electronic gadgets effects bad on health of the public because they do little physical work. For example if people do not do physical work but they eat normal food. They will have to face many health issues. That is reason why machines are harmful for the people. In my opinion, I think that machines are important in future because it helps to save time and money by doing work in short time. It makes the life comfortable. But with some restrictions. In conclusion, robots are important in current time and in future because it help in development of hman being. But it effects on employees by reducing their jobs and physical health.

They have a redundant amount of information and user-friendly interface which lets you study in a convenient environment.

On the other hand, smartphones may cause physical and mental health problems. Smartphones can make it hard for students to concentrate on studying, leading to low productivity and poor performance. So smartphones should be banned at primary school that allows students to focus more on learning, and as a result, they can get better grades.

First of all, mobile phones are a main cause of distraction from class learning. Students are not focused on subjects in the classroom by messages, playing games, using social networks and notifications which lead to poor exam and assignment performance. For example, my niece got low grades in her primary school classes because she is often messaging and playing with her mobile phone during lectures. Furthermore, smartphones can have detrimental effects on students’ health if misused or overused. In addition, phone’s screen light can harm the eyes and the radiation from this device is not good for your brain and your health. For example, student spend long hours closely staring at the screen of mobile phones.

What are the effects of online shopping on society or local communities?,"Nowadays, with the rapid change of lifestyle, online shopping is no longer a fresh word to people. It has effects on society and local communities, both the pros and cons. The explanation of both views will be discussed in the following paragraphs.

Several merits constitute the success of online shopping. Firstly, the complex situation of the Covid-19 epidemic has had a significant impact on many people's shopping habits. Thus, online shopping is considered the most effective solution. For example, having a delivery man come to our house when shopping over the Internet will help us ensure social distance and avoid the risk of disease.

Secondly, online shopping is convenient, people can easily access stores throughout the world as well as purchase goods with a mere swipe or click of fingers. For instance, to place an order, all you have to do is select the product and confirm the order through smartphones. As a result, we do not waste time on traffic.

Finally, the diversity of products present on the websites has been intriguing the customers. Thousands of versions and designs of a commodity can be seen and even compared within no time. Let us consider a situation, when a consumer visits a shop in person he or she can only go through a very less number of products.

On the other hand, there are a variety of demerits of shopping via the Internet. Firstly, online shopping is the most popular platform that cybercrimes use. This means that some people, especially children and the older, are usually deceived since sellers can fake their profiles on the internet. To exemplify, many students opt to buy a laptop via Facebook. Hence, they lose their money and do not get their goods back.

Secondly, online shopping can be addictive, you might spend more money and time buying stuff that is not necessary. Moreover, items might be different from what you see in online shops.

In conclusion, I believe that the benefits of online shopping significantly outweigh the drawbacks. Therefore, individuals should carefully utilize these technologies in terms of security and privacy.",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6

Write an essay of 250 words on the following topic: What are the advantages and disadvantages of using technology in modern society?,"It is increasingly clear that technology has made human life become easier and more convenient than in the past. However, it also has both pros and cons which I am going to discuss in the paragraph below.

Beginning with the positive points, the arrival of technology has redefined the way people interact with each other. In today's society, communication technology has made it exceedingly simple for people to connect with others all over the world. For example, in the past, people could only contact by sending letters; now, anyone can communicate with anyone else anywhere in the globe simply by using a smartphone. Furthermore, employing technology can boost staff work productivity. People may do their jobs faster and more flexibly even in the toughest circumstances, such as social distancing caused by Covid-19.

On the other hand, if technology is abused, it will cause some drawbacks. First and foremost, humans will grow increasingly reliant on technology, and certain jobs may be automated in the future. Instead of hiring humans, corporations might save money by purchasing equipment to assist them in their job, which may lead to unemployment status. Furthermore, individuals may lose touch with reality and become immersed in the technological world. Indeed, many people prefer to spend more time on their phones, watching TV, or playing video games than they do with their friends or family. It may cause communication between people to be disrupted, as well as isolated.

To conclude, technology has undeniable advantages that make life simpler. People might broaden their contacts and operate more effectively thanks to advances. However, there are some downsides that must be acknowledged and avoided as soon as possible.",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6.5
Modern society and social networks or real-time conversations,"As a matter of fact, in the modern society most juveniles tend to interact with family members and their peers through social media, rather than talking in reality or making phone calls. While I do admit that this trend has many benefits for productivity and time management, in my opinion, it can also have its negative impact on individuals' social lives.

On the one hand, using social networking sites for communication saves time for both sides. In other words, social media gives us a great opportunity to write messages in any time of the day and also enables the respondent to answer it at any suitable time for them/ him or her. Not only it shows respect for time of both individuals, but it also gives a chance for both parties to analyze information and give a thoughtful answer. Moreover, social media is very pleasant to the eye with its precisely arranged design and interface. Young people enjoy spending time on social platforms such as Instagram due to various functions it provides. For instance, the youngsters are able to share photos and videos with one another and be aware of recent news/ stay in touch with the current trends/ bring up to date on news. In addition, it makes them easier to find topics for a conversation and have a deeper connection.

Having said that, there are many drawbacks of excessive use of social media among adolescents. Firstly, kids spend most of their time online, which causes various health problems, such as short-sightedness, sclerosis and obesity. Additionally/ Furthermore, due to the lack of real-life communication, most young people have psychological problems and find it hard to talk to their peers. Face to face conversations tend to be very poor in consistency and meaning among our generation. Lack of confidence, fear of public, inability of talking to audiences and in big groups are the most common issues faced by today’s generation.

Taking everything into consideration, development in social interactions has many benefits for all of us, however, real life conversations should never be forgotten by our society.",No,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5
Living together before marriage: Good or bad idea?,"Nowadays, there are many couples living together before marriage. Sometimes these 'cohabitation' relationships work well and sometimes they don't. In my opinion, living together before marriage has more advantages than disadvantages. Firstly, I really believe that cohabiting will prevent a lot of fights and divorces. Living together tests relationships with people and allows to see if one can tolerate a partner's annoying habits. For example, more than 60 percent of Americans believe that moving in together before marriage is a good way to avoid divorce. Also, make sure it doesn't affect things too much if they break up. Couples are not married so they have nothing to tie their relationship to. Last but not least, when they move in together, they can easily solve their financial problems. Young people sometimes want to take risks, so proper money management can be a big step at first for all soon-to-be couples. In my opinion, I believe that cohabitation is a great idea for couples who are still contemplating marriage. ",No,No,No,No,No,No,5.5
What do you think of the effects on society of individuals being too proud of material possessions,"The fact that many young people, particularly those with social standing, are following such materialistic tendencies will affect an entire generation, making other young people value property ownership rather than spiritual values or social sentiments.

-Individuals who are only concerned with owning luxury items will not pay attention to other people in society who are going through a difficult time. As a result, they will widen the gap between the rich and the poor. ",No,No,No,No,No,No,5.5
How to reduce the rate of the breakdown of a marriage in America?,"Divorce rates in the United States have climbed dramatically in the last 25 years. According to What affects divorce rates in the U. S (2021), the writer explained that “In the United States, about half of all marriages end in divorce or separation and 41 percent of all first marriages end in divorce” (p. 1). There are a lot of problems on all the people involved. Typically, the guy must deal with not seeing his children, being alone, and the responsibilities that come with most of the legal process. The wife has to go through, maybe, entering the workforce for the first time. In addition; for example, on the effect of divorce on America, for providing each year, over 1 million American children suffer the divorce of their parents. The kids may begin to feel insecure around their peers and even in their self-esteem, and they may become despondent or even defiant. As a result, it is critical to understand ways to lower the divorce rate. It is worth noting that sharing household chores, seeing trust, listening well, and being faithful play a significant role in marriage.

For the majority of married individuals, sharing household chores is a vital component of marriage. As far as I know, in the United States, ambiguity in the sharing of domestic tasks between working couples frequently leads to dissatisfaction, resentment, and conflict. According to Eight facts about love and marriage, the author stated that “ More than half of married adults in the United States (56 percent) agree that sharing household tasks is ""extremely important"" to a good marriage, whether they have children or not” (p. 1). A guy understands his wife's suffering when they share housework, and the wife feels affection, connection, and loves her husband even more. Every marriage is unique, and finding meaningful ways to serve them necessitates getting to know your spouse and listening to their life, and helping their work. Accordingly, two people who pay attention to the other person's world and choose to satisfy specific needs are at the heart of any thriving marriage.

The survey of CDFA Professionals Reveal The Leading Causes of Divorce from across North America (2013) stated that one of the leading causes of divorce is “basic incompatibility” (43%), which is usually caused by underlying concerns in the relationship-usually an emotional or physical one; especially, trust is also one of them. To be honest, you cannot love someone if you do not believe in them. As previously stated, trust is the foundation of love. Your spouse needs to know that you are trustworthy and will not abandon them in bad circumstances, just as a child trusts and loves his or her mother. This emotion is necessary for love to grow and flourish. Without trust, every minute of your life becomes a nightmare. In fact, an untrustworthy relationship is chaotic and destructive. After all, trust means you can rely on your spouse, confide and feel safe with them. Hence, it greatly aids in the reduction of marital quarrels.

In a little more detail, we must learn to listen well. Scott, et al. (2013) claimed that too much disagreement and bickering, as well as failing to listen, were cited by 57. 7% of people as key contributors to divorce (p. 3). When you've been married for a long time, you might begin to question what happened to your strong, communicative connection. Perhaps you have endured too many fights and accusations that you do not listen anymore. You can reclaim your capacity and willingness to listen to your partner by taking certain steps. Pay attention to your spouse's words, as well as their actions. In the book, “Take back your marriage” from one of America’s favorite therapists, the author stated that we get too used to our mate, and we do not care about them, do not listen to them. If we don't attempt to reintroduce these elements into our relationships, they will lose part of their newness and freshness over time (p. 15). Therefore, we need to build a rhythm of service that transforms the trajectory of our marriage when we share each other, train our eyes to see in a different manner, and take the time to listen to what our spouse genuinely needs. This is critical in preventing marriage breakup.

Viewed from different sides, there is no doubt that if a couple is entirely faithful to one another, their love will last a lifetime. According to statistics in the Journal of Comparative Family Studies (2010), the writer explained that “In the United States, marriage is conceptualized as a monogamous, lifelong partnership. Yet American practices do not support this conceptualization, which is evidenced by infidelity and divorce rates that approximate 25-50 percent” (p. 1). Moreover, in the article "" Who cheats more? The demographics of infidelity in America"", the author showed in America, men are more likely than women to cheat: 20% of men and 13% of women reported that they sex with someone other than their spouse while married” (p. 1). Thus, loyalty plays an important role in reducing divorce rates. If you do not want to be faithful, why are you in that marriage? Being dependable has a beneficial impact on your personality. You'll be able to confidently live out your greatness this way. Integrity is crucial, and it begins with how you live your private life; it confers moral power. Everything else will fall apart if you mess up your personal life. Therefore, when you publicly show loyalty to your lover, you will be respected and admired by the public.

In conclusion, it takes effort to protect, nurture, and grow a marriage. With work schedules, children, and other responsibilities, it can seem impossible to keep that partnership going. When troubles occur, some couples decide that divorcing and going their separate ways is a better option. Consequently, sharing household chores, seeing trust, listening well, and being faithful contribute to the diminishing divorce rate in America. But frankly speaking, you can meet thousands of people, yet none of them have an impact on you. Then you meet someone and your life is forever changed. As a result, because finding the one you truly love is so difficult, why did we choose to split up when we got together? Because we are one, let us take care of each other and love each other as much as we can. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,5

They have become so popular in today's society that it is hard to imagine life without them. Nearly everyone owns one because of its wide range of advantage that we get from our smartphone.

Firstly, smartphone is a communication tool that is used to communicate with our family or friend anywhere, anytime because it’s portable.

"n many developed countries, there is a phenomenon that people increase income, get married late","In many developed countries, there is a phenomenon that people increase income, get married later, and have fewer children/ kids. This leads to an aging population which has more negatives than possitives on society.

First of all, as more people reach their twilight years, they will face increasing health problems and this puts huge pressure on healthcare system, (and) other social programmes and government ‘s budget. The government pays for the costs of heal care, not to mention things like pensions, all of which means a big bill someone has to pay for. Secondly, with an increasing aging population and more people retiting. There will be fewer people to work, this will crate a economic hole in order to, grow a country’s GDP, the government needs to outsource a great number of labours to meet the need of producing goods and service every year. This means the countries rely greatly on/ depend greatly on on immigration to fill the gap which is an undesirable solution.

However, we should also view/ consider tho positives the elderly bring to a country. Old people still make contribution to society, whether it means helping look after children, working part time job or even doing volunteer work. On an individual level, old people can be a real treasure.

In conclusion, I adhere that the old people more negatives than positives on society. The government should this realize and has suitable derection in the development of the country. ",No,No,Yes,No,No,No,5

However, a plethora of people believe that the traditional education system is more useful for undergraduates who can get knowledge. I personally agree with this argument.

The rapid development of technology has had a significant impact on modern education. Numerous students can get knowledge by learning online courses through the internet. The easy access to various resources of course has allowed students to learn any subject they are interested in at any time of the day. Additionally, it is undeniable that students have access to an unlimited amount of information via the internet. This learning experience is also beneficial for students who can easily acquire more subject knowledge with many perspectives. There are some recent surveys which have indicated that about ninety percent of students are ready to register for an online course. Besides, the increase in television channels has also provided students with further potential sources of education.

Notwithstanding having an enormous amount of data on the internet, teachers have played a vital role in contemporary society. Undergraduates ought to learn many practical skills in spite of acquiring theoretical knowledge only. In the competitive world, it is very important to be well-educated and knowledgeable. For instance, a student cannot aesthetically draw a picture by acquiring theoretical knowledge only. Apparently, they have to combine aesthetic theory and drawing skill. It is generally not provided through online courses or television. Consequently, their ability to draw is greatly reduced by learning via the internet.

To recapitulate, it is true that a plethora of students have a tendency to learn more from online courses than teachers in school and university. Even so, traditional education also has a critical role to play in society. ",No,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5
Art is considered an important part of society and impression of culutre. Do you think children should learn art? Should student focus on art instead of other subjects,"It is axiomatic fact that art is not only express the culture but also is the wrap and wroof part of the society. To my mind, art should be learnt by children because it can help them to become creative; children should infulence to focus on both art and other subjects as well, instead of any one. So thiss essay shall articulate further views as below: Examining the advantage to teach art to the juviniles, it is ponder that art knowledge can help to boost up the creativeness of children. It is, therefore, since by art imagination power of the offsprings can proliferate by which they become eager to show their creativity in unique way that can help them to become renowned by doing excellent work. For instance, a teenager boy, now known as master mind boy globally made a mechanical robot by enhancing their knowledge about the engineering art. Consequently, art genrate the ability inthe child to do different and praiseful. Thus, teaching art to the children is considered an important. Although offsprings should encourage to focus on art yet the importance of other subjects can not be neglected such as science and maths. It is simply because, however, learning art is beneficial for the juviniles but if other main subjects are left aside they cannot compete with their peers inthis contemporary era. For example, when children not emphasize on remain courses; while he/she is good in art their knowledge still incomplete and in other domains they can lack behind such as in studies that either related to medical or mechanical. As a result, children should not only be good in art rather than other subjects, as both are equally important. In conclusion, undoubtedly, art is an impression of tradition and society's integral part, also should taught to the juviniles but the pivotal role of other courses should also put into consideration.

"Smoking is harmful for the health of the consumer. Some people say that due to its harmful impact, the consumption must be completely banned from our society. Do you agree or disagree?","It is a true fact that the health of a smoker is negatively affected by smoking. In this case, there are some analysts who believe that the consumption of tobacco products in our society must be completely banned. I strongly agree with the above mentioned proposal due to notable reasons.

There is a variety of factors which prove that smoking must be completely prohibited. First and foremost, negative health issues can be a significant reason to be considered. It is generally believed that if a smoker smokes cigarettes, it will certainly affect their physical health in a negative way. The fact can be demonstrated by the Australian research from 2014, which proved that the chance of getting lung cancer is increased by 60%, if you smoke. Moreover, financial pressure may be another factor to take into account. Therefore, it is apparent why no one should be able to purchase cigarettes.

Despite the reasons discussed above in regard to complete exclusion of tobacco, the idea of keeping tobacco products on the market cannot be ignored. An effective source of revenue can be a noteworthy aspect. It may be defined as many governments, such as the Australian and German, are able to make huge profits due to high taxes on tobacco. Furthermore, stress relief from the consumption of nicotine can be another imperative point.

In conclusion, indeed, there are some positive points for keeping cigarettes on the shelves; however, as far as I am concerned, it is still essential to ban smoking due to the reasons mentioned before. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6
Divorce is the situation in which two people terminate their relationship after a period of marriage.,"Divorce is the situation in which two people terminate their relationship after a period of marriage. The reason for this situation comes from many sides, not only from the family but also from many social impacts. The economy, domestic violence, and the pressures of life. Moroever, It makes the husband and wife always feel suffocated, difficult to breathe even in their own home. Infidelity is the reason divorce has been on the rise over the years. Most families with an adulterous spouse come to a breakup. In addition, the views and lifestyles between the two people do not fit together so there are frequent quarrels and the longer the explosion is bigger and divorce is inevitable. The breakdown of marriage not only affects family and relatives but also affects society. Especially their children. Therefore, couples need to be aware of their role and position in family building, love, listen and share, respect each other, live responsibly with the family and society.",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,5
Under British and Australian laws a jury in a criminal case has no access to information about the defendant's past criminal record. This protects the person who is being accused of the crime. Some lawyers have suggested that this practice should be changed and that a jury should be given all the past facts before they reach their decision about the case. Do you agree or disagree?,"The discussion on hand is about past records of a criminal being available to the jury or not. I disagree with the current law of protecting the criminal.

In my opinion humans are primordial by nature and a lot is said about them from there line of ancestry and previous behaviors patterns which some studies say that sometimes is part of their DNA. To be able to fully justify the verdict on a case, jury needs to confirm if the criminal is committing crimes out of habit.

The said technique may able to bring forth a behavior pattern in case of one and justice be provided according to the criminal history. It could be possible that the criminal needs mental help more than being put in a correction facility or worse.

I understand that the judgement could be colored on basis of the history of the person but that brings me to question my faith in the jurors which I do not want to do. No citizen should have to question the integrity of their judicial system. I would rather believe in their objectivity and sense of justice to provide a judgement to the criminal as necessary or required.

Think of this in this way, when we buy a product sometimes we are so brand specific because we know that the brand ensures a certain quality level and has been around in the market for a long time. So, we know that what we are putting are money on is sound. hence the idea that the criminal's past record being known is like knowing how long and true this person has been in the past and if the person requires something more than just being let go in the society once again, prison or some other facility to help the cause of this person.

Criminality is growing among children and teenagers? Why it is growing and how criminals should be treated?,"The crime rate was increasing day by day among children and teenagers due to some reasons. This is burning issue, but every problem come with solution which I will discuss in coming paragraphs. 'Nobody is born criminal ' it depend on the environment in which the children is living. For instance TV serials are reason to commit crime. In a recent news one youngster in America killed his friends after watching a movie. In addition, poverty and unemployment was another reason of crime. Many children's do crimes like pick pocketing, stealing food items and many more. Poor children was unable to eat, so they do petty crimes. Another reason is lack of education, the children who was illiterate do not know bad effects of doing crimes. Hence these are reasons because of which teenagers do crimes. Furthermore, if criminals do serious crimes like rape, murder and robbery they should be hang to death, so that other people have fear to do crime moreover, the people who do petty crimes should be given a voluntary work so that they can change themselves simillarly, government can also contribute to stop these criminal activity by providing better education and employment. Thus these are some ways to treat a criminal. In conclusion, lack of education, employment and poverty leads children to do crime conversely, to treat criminal who do not do serious crime should be given voluntary work.",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,5
The issue oIt is true that some criminals commit crimes again after they have been punished.,"The issue oIt is true that some criminals commit crimes again after they have been punished. While there are several reasons for this alarming trend, some effective measures can be taken by governments to tackle this problem.

There are two main reasons for re-offenders. Firstly, the prison system can make the situation worse. Criminals put together in prison and they make friends with other offenders. While they are locked up in prison, they do not have much to do there, and they would exchange information about what they have done before they came to the prison or they may plan crimes with other inmates. Secondly, offenders often do not have any other means of earning money. They are poor, uneducated and lacking skills needed to maintain a job. Also, a criminal record makes finding a job difficult as people usually avoid hiring ex-convict.

To solve this problem, governments should focus on rehabilitation of criminals rather than punishment. Above all, prisons need vocational training which makes inmates to prepare for life outside the prison. They can learn practical skills such as computer programming, car maintenance and graphic design. In this way, they can be hired for a position that requires this certain knowledge and skills. Community service is another way to reform offenders. Rather than being locked up in prison with other inmates, offenders can help society and become useful to their local community, and these activities would eliminate the negative influence that prisons can have.

In conclusion, it is true the re-offenders are one of the problems in our community; it can be solved by focusing rehabilitation rather than punishment itself.

f whether or not children should be engaged in some paid work has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that having some employment experience is conducive to a child’s learning and development, I contend that it would bring harm to the child’s heath and learning.

First of all, a workplace designed for adults is normally shortage of child-friendly facilities. Desks and chairs are too high for a child; the light switches are installed on the walls unreachable by children; also emergency training and facilities such as phones are only provided to adults. Furthermore, various hazards such as polluted air and chemical fumes are still produced in factories and farms. Undoubtedly young people would suffer in such workplaces.

Also, children would find it frustrating when they are not properly inducted before starting a job. A child working in a cement factory would feel a setback when he could not get immediate support while struggling with the procedures of recording different raw materials that is required by the job. Further, without sufficient support, a child’s misunderstanding or inappropriately communicating with adults would only disappoint him and prevents him from active learning and interacting with other people.

To conclude, a child’s paid employment experience would lead to a negative impact on their health and active learning. However, recognizing the importance of children’s learning and their awareness of responsibility, it is advisable to encourage them to be involved in some volunteering opportunities where they can meaningfully learn and interact with other people with sufficient care and support in place for such jobs.

Some people believe that there should be the death penalty for extremely serious crimes. Others believe that it is not morally correct to kill criminals. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.,"One of the most controversial issues today relates to whtehr to use capital punishment or not. In this essay, I am going to examine this question from both points of view and then give my own perspective on the matter.

On one side of the argument there are people who argue that the benefits of killing violent criminalsconsiderably outweigh its disadvantages. The main reason for believing this is that the fear of execution acts as a deterrent to commit serious crimes such as rape and murder. It is also possible to say that the execution of a criminal may bring relief to the suffering victims. One good illustration of this is when Sadam Hussein was executed. Many of the victims who were persecuted under his rule expressed joy and relief when he was finally captured and killed.

On the other hand, it is also possible to make the opposing case. It is often argued that in fact sentencing criminals to death is just committing another murder. People often have this opinion because they think that it is immoral to take another person’s life, no matter what the reason is. A second point is that many religions are opposed to any form of murder. A particularly good example here is from the bible, which lists killing another person as one of the Ten Commandments that should not be broken.

In my opinion, both arguments have their merits. On balance, however, I tend to believe that capital punishment is justified in cases of extreme crime and that deterring violent crime is more important than taking the moral high ground espoused in the bible.",Yes,No,No,No,No,No,5.5
The prison system has not been effective at reforming criminals. A large number of convicted felons return to committing crimes soon after being released. What are the problems with the prison system and what solution can you recommend to address this issue?,"The phenomenon of keeping the criminals behind the bars has not proven to be so successful in their rehabilitation and most of the prisoners return to their evil world just after being released. In this essay, initially, we will be discussing the issues with the current prison system and later, some feasible methods to curb this problem will be examined.

To begin with, our prison systems are less focussed towards educating the criminals rather it is just about punishing them for their offences. To further explain, usually, the penitentiary staff mistreats the prisoners and place them in extremely small cells in an isolation, due to which they gain more hatred against the society and repeat their crimes after getting released. For example, Newzealand gathered all those prisoners convicted in any public safety act who were mostly teenagers and educated them quite well, surprisingly, most of them are in colleges now, pursuing higher education and proving to be an asset for the country.

Considering the above problem there are few potential solutions to reform the criminals. Firstly, there should be proper education in the jails and the younger prisoners should get proper schooling inside the lockup which will develop their mentality and give them a chance to restart their life. Secondly, the punishment should be given as per the crime carried by the convicted and the proper assistance and guidance should be provided by the prison administration to ensure that the person should not face the same situation which led him to commit the crime previously. For instance, if a prisoner has been convicted of the robbery he must be in some financial crisis, therefore, if he is assisted financially and guided properly, he can start a simple business once he completes his sentence.

To conclude, the existing cell system is just for the purpose of punishing the prisoners instead of teaching them the moral ethics and educating them to be better citizens. However, if some alterations are done in this system like opening the schools inside jails and helping the prisoners to deal with the situations that led them to commit some lawlessness, there will be a huge transformation in our society, in result crime-rate will diminish.

Some people think certain prisoners should be made to do unpaid community work instead of being put behind the bar. To What extend do you agree ?,"In the last few decades, how to treat with the criminals, it has been Concerning

issue for the government and society. A few individual opine that government

should compulsory doing unpaid work for the prisoners, in liue of Put in the jail. I

partially agree with the statement. My explanation is justified in further

paragraphs.

To begin, there are many reasons for prisoners doing volunteering work for

community. Predominant reason is that they are being respectful person and useful

for the society and nation after they relive the bar. To elaborate this, they are

working for society: Cleaning the street; Planting the trees; working for charity

and many more, they indulge in this activities. Therefore, it can help to reduce

the environment problems and prevent the become a harsh criminal. Another

reason is that harsh evil minded and normal criminal are very different, therefore,

treat with the different laws. For instance, according to LCB – London Central

branch, myriad of counties treat their criminal according to their crime. Which can

help to prevent the crime and become free crime city.

On the contrary, the brutal offenders involved in series crime: Murder; Hijacking;

Rape; and Abduction, these type of criminal, government not only put in the jail

but also, must be doing a capital punishment. Owning to these harsh punishment,

criminal have not been doing this type of crime. To add to this, if they are not keep

in the bar, in liue of doing unpaid activities, they will have been repeating same

crime and this is a terrible impact upon the societies and nation’s. Therefore, make

a strict laws for lawbreakers. For an example, after the terrorist attack of 26/11 in

Mumbai city upon taj hotel, a capita punishment of terrorist had been given by the

Some people believe that violence shown today on entertainment media is the cause of criminal activity in the society. Is this true? What can be done to address this issue?,"A group of people have the opinion that, the reason for increasing crimes in today's society is the violence seen on the entertainment channel. It is true to some extend and there are several ways to resolve this issue.

First of all, it is true that, nowadays, the crime rate is increased due to the violence seen in the entertainment field. The main cause of this is the youngsters have the tendency to imitate what they saw in the films and other media. It is because they consider the heroes and heroines as role models and try to follow the things they are shown in media. Teenagers think that whatever shown in the media is right and might misunderstand it as original life. They have a huge curiosity and tendency to imitate the criminal activities shown in entertainment media and become criminals and might ruin their entire life.

The best way to solve this issue is to give awareness to young people in society. This can be done by parents, teachers, and government authorities. Convince them that orginal life is entirely different from entertainment life. For that, the media can telecast interviews of famous personalities themselves to give awareness to the society that this is only for getting fame and money and not to copy it in people's life. Counseling given in school is another way to reduce the imitating tendency of youngsters. This may help in reducing crime rates.

To conclude, brutality shown in entertainment shows is one of the reasons for increasing crimes. To solve this issue young people in society need to reduce their following tendency otherwise it will negatively affect people's life as well as society. ",No,No,Yes,No,No,No,5.5
Under British and Australian laws a jury in a criminal case has no access to information about the defendant's past criminal record. This protects the person who is being accused of the crime. Some lawyers have suggested that this practice should be changed and that a jury should be given all the past facts before they reach their decision about the case. Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"The judges in The Britain and Australia have no track of the culprit's previous criminal activities. It is thought that this lack of access to the perpetrator's criminal data as a savior for the culprit. A proportion of lawyers is of the view that such a practice should be abolished, and before reaching any verdict, judges should look in to the past criminal activity data of the person facing the trial. Even though a crime is always liable to punishment, I am totally supportive of the idea that the panel must keep in view the culprit's past activities, and this discussion will elaborate my viewpoint.

The jurisdiction law in the United Kingdom and Australia denies the judges all the access to the person's past criminal activity record. In my view, one does not simply commit a heinous act in a whim. A criminal act, be it minor or a major activity, is always a deliberate attempt. A hard pill to swallow, most of the criminals facing trials are regular law-breakers. One can not simply just pretend that the person woke up on the wrong side of bed and ended up doing an illegal act out. For example, last week as I was going through the daily newspaper, I read about a young guy who was caught sexually assaulting a young lady red handed. The trial in his case not only did investigate the current crime, the judges also went through his past criminal record; as it turned out, there previously had been many cases of sexual harassment and assaults reported against him, but he was never punished due to lack of evidence. Reviewing the past criminal record of a person not only establishes the evidence, it also reinstates his position as a culprit.

Second, the record of one's previous unlawful activities can help the jury set a punishment accordingly. One who's trial is supported by a series of illegal activities in the past should be penalized accordingly. This, not only sets an example of a crystal clear justice, it also acts as a message to any one who is at the verge of doing an unlawful act. For example, the same perpetrator I talked about in the previous paragraph; he was brought castrated chemically. This clearly sent out message to anyone, who in their remotest of notions, were thinking of sexually assaulting another person. The past criminal record thus helps establish a criterion for punishment.

While the laws can be contradictory, I am of the view that the judges should always keep in view the past criminal activity data of the person facing the trial, as many of them are regular offenders. This also establishes how severe a punishment should the criminal be subjected to.",No,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5
Some people think certain prisoners should be made to do unpaid community work instead of being put behind the bar. To What extend do you agree ?,"In the last few decades, how to treat with the criminals, it has been Concerning

issue for thegovernment and society. A few individual opine that government

should compulsory doing unpaid work for the prisoners, in liue of Put in the jail. I

partially agree with the statement. My explanation is justified in further Paragraphs.

To begin, there are many reasons for prisoners doing volunteering work for

community. Predominant reason is that they are being respectful person and useful for the society and nation after they relive the bar. To elaborate this, they are working for society: Cleaning the street; Planting the trees; working for charity and many more, they indulge in this activities. Therefore, it can help to reduce the environment problems and prevent the become a harsh criminal. Another reason is that harsh evil minded and normal criminal are very different, therefore, treat with the different laws. For instance, according to LCB – London Central branch, myriad of counties treat their criminal according to their crime. Which can help to prevent the crime and become free crime city. On the contrary, the brutal offenders involved in series crime: Murder; Hijacking;

Rape; and Abduction, these type of criminal, government not only put in the jail but also, must be doing a capita punishment. Owning to these harsh punishment, criminal have not been doing this type of crime. To add to this, if they are not keep in the bar, in liue of doing unpaid activities, they will have been repeating same

crime and this is a terrible impact upon the societies and nation’s. Therefore, make

a strict laws for lawbreakers. For an example, after the terrorist attack of 26/11 in Mumbai city upon taj hotel, a capita punishment of terrorist had been given by the government. In a concluding note, the government has been treating the criminal in different ways. Minor criminal are doing volunteering work and they become a good person. Capital punishment and send to the jail to harsh criminal by the government",No,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5
"Studies show that crime rates are lower among those with educational degrees. Therefore, the best way to reduce the crime rate is to educate criminals while they are still in prison. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","One of the most controversial subjects among both scholars and citizens is whether education can decrease the crime rate or not. Whereas some individuals highly argue that the crime rate and higher education have a converse relationship, others argue that the reduced crime rate has nothing to do with the higher education level. However, for the sake of this essay, I highly support the second group’s theory. Higher education level can not only have no impact on the crime rate but may also elucidate the crime path for many criminals.

It might seem to be right that the higher the education of a person, the lower the chance of committing a crime will be. According to the latest psychological and criminological studies, in the University of Michigan, committing a crime or becoming a criminal can be addictive. While some people commit unlawful behaviors only because they have poor financial status, many convicts tend to have unlawful behaviors only because they enjoy them. According to that research, the level of testosterone and adrenaline, two of the most important hormones in the human body, are highly boosted when criminals are committing their wrong behaviors. After a few times, these felons will have a sense of satisfaction by continuing their criminal acts. As a result, most criminals do not commit felony just because they have poor financial status, they commit crimes because of the sheer joy of it.

Higher education, especially in the field of information technology and computer sciences, will widen the horizons of criminals and allow them to explore new criminal activities. Hackers, for instance, is one of these people. Every year, banks and financial organizations spend billions of dollars on their security that can be threatened by highly educated computer gigs. Another example is the educated electrical engineers, whose adrenaline level will be reached to a high level by committing crimes. These people can easily defuse the alarm and anti-theft systems. To conclude, education can upgrade criminals’ knowledge and make them unbeatable.

To conclude, no matter how educated criminals become, as long as the morality has not been elucidated for them, they will remain in their former occupations for the rest of their lives. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,5.5
"Many criminals re-offend after they have been punished. Why do some people continue to commit crimes after they have been punished, and what measures can be taken to tackle this problem?","Several convicted criminals are inclined to repeat their misdeeds after finishing their sentence period. Although some causes bring about this phenomenon, the current problem could be addressed by two main remedies.

The willingness of offenders to repeat their previous wrongdoings appears to stem from two main reasons. First off, numerous individuals do not possess a suitable job to earn their livelihood after their punishment, and because of their prison experience, the employers cannot be convinced to hire them. As a result, it leaves no options unless recommitting the crime. Furthermore, the laws of punishment might not be enforced seriously, or they are not deterrent enough to prevent criminals from re-offending crimes. For instance, in ROMANIA, if a thief steals some products which cost under 500 euros, he will not be punished by police. Therefore, he would not take this kind of punishment seriously and repeat stealing easily.

Turning to the possible solutions, second to none, the authorities should establish some organizations to follow and support the criminals during and after their sentencing, meaning that to incorporate beneficial rehabilitation courses while they are in prison, these range from training some professional skills to make them ready for entering the society to conducting some consultation sessions to improve criminals’ mentality. Consequently, after this period, these organizations should assure economic and social situation of offenders, it means that in case of any issues, accomplish some actions such as accumulating money for them from charities or finding a job. Otherwise, they will again be misled for making money. Moreover, some strict sentencing should be employed by governments to discourage individuals from committing crimes. The example can be seen in Arab countries that in any case of rubbery, no matter what it is, the offenders must pay a huge amount of money. Spontaneously, no one even thinks of breaking the law in these countries.

To conclude, admittedly, two underlying factors such as lacking occupations or improper methods of punishments may lead individuals to repeatedly commit a crime. Nevertheless, by enforcement of some serious rules of sentencing and economically and socially supporting criminals, this problem could be properly addressed. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6
"Many criminals commit further crimes as soon as they are released from prison. What do you think are the causes of this? What effect will this have on society? Crime rate has increased manifold these days. Inspite of punishment, many convicts repeat the crimes when they get released from jail. It can happen due oni several other reasons. In my opinion, the government and society needs to take action to solve this problem.","There are many reasons that encourage criminals to commit crime again. There are some factors like social stigma, lack of employment and not getting emotional support. No any employer prefers to give job opportunity to ex-convict. Consequently, they do not get financially support. In some cases, ex-convicts do not get support from their own families. AS a result, they feel lonely and become homeless. In addition, our society do not want ex-convicts to become part of their communities and treat them with suspician. All these factors lead to the criminal to commit crime and they become violent.

However, these problems can be avoided by government's intervention and changes in the people outlook towards these criminals. The government should introduce some policies and organize training for them for the employment in the prison itself. Government should start some rehibiliation centres. Afterwards, it can change the criminal's mindset and they will start living peacefully. Constant psychological counselling is necessary for the criminals and their families to rebuild personal relationships.

To conclude, though there are number of factors which encourage criminals to commit crimes again, the government and society should take the responsibility to rehabiliate ex-criminals so as to prevent them from committing further crimes. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,5
"Some people say that excessive noise should be a criminal offence, while others say they should be free to make noise without limitation. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","It is argued that extreme noise must be considered as an unlawful activity, while others believe that people should not be restricted to create noise. This essay agrees with the first given notion because deafening sound can result in permanent hearing loss in older generations and also causes sleep disturbance for many, thus it can be called a crime despite the belief among people that it is a human right to live on their own terms and playing loud music is a part of their lifestyle.

Unreasonable sound can lead to sleep deprivation and also affect hearing ability of a person. In other words, playing loud music for a longer period of time, especially at night can be disturbing for others. Moreover, long exposure to extreme noise can hamper hearing ability and disturb the normal sleep cycle. For instance, according to a recent research conducted in Australia, it was found that older people are more likely to suffer from hearing loss if exposed to excessive noise pollution and deprives a person of his normal sleep. Hence, it is certainly a criminal offence to create noise pollution.

On the other hand, several people think that it is their right to play loud music and live as per their choice. This is to say that restricting them from creating extreme sound is not right because they consider it is a violation of their rights. Furthermore, many say that it is a matter of perspective, therefore, different people have different lifestyles. To exemplify, several people prefer to live in a peaceful environment while it is disturbing for others. Thus, there should not be a limit to make noise as it is a part of an individual's lifestyle.

To conclude, enormous sound pollution can lead to hearing loss and sleep disturbance, which makes it an unlawful act. However, others think it is completely normal to produce extreme noise because it is one of their human rights. ",Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,7
Some people think certain prisoners should be made to do unpaid community work instead of being put behind bars. To what extent do you agree?,"It is believed by many that unpaid voluntary work for the community is a better punishment for some prisoners than imprisonment. I completely agree with this opinion, however, and will explain how this type of punishment can improve an offender’s life and society as a whole.

Some people are of the opinion that every offenders should get imprisonment for strict rehabilitation process. Harsh experience is needed for those who have committed a crime whether it is big or small. Otherwise, the offenders will repeat this crime as they would be sure about the consequences which would not affect them much. As a result, many people in the society get involved with petty crime as a repercussion of a seemingly mild punishment. Thus, offenders may need to be put behind bars regardless of their level of crime as an example to other people in the society.

However, voluntary work in the local neighbourhood as a punishment will be better rehabilitation for some offenders. Firstly, different punishment should be assigned to different offenders based on their respective crimes and age. For example, if a teenager gets imprisonment for his offence, there is a higher chance of him getting into a bigger trouble as he will be in touch with more serious prisoners than him. As a result, he can be misled and eventually become a serious offender. What is more, voluntary community work will give the offenders a new perspective towards life as he will be given chance to help others. Therefore, it is entirely justified that community work should be given as a punishment instead of setting him up for a sour future as imprisonment would be a deterrent to his recuperation.

In conclusion, rehabilitation process is of paramount importance in terms of giving punishment to offenders. While some people are in favours of imprisonment as a punishment for all offenders, I believe it is absolutely imperative that their punishment is justified with their level of

Many criminals commiy further crimes as soon as they are released from prison what are the causes of it and what affect will occur on society ?,"Majority of wrongdoers do further misdeed as they are free from incarceration, this essay will analyse potential causes such as peer influence and trouble in finding employment along with some feasible solutions like providing instructors and imposing high penalties. To commence with, impact of other immates is the pre-eminent cause why offenders commit more crime, reason being, lack of investment in rehabilitation resources prisoners are accumulated near each other by which they meet new prisoners and share their ideas after that their morale is boosted for committing crime moreover, after releasing from prison some join particular groups which grant then further confidence, for a case in point, In 2012 Britain witnessed a drastic rise of 20 million in number of offenders due to lack of rehabilitation, to mitigate it, government should hire instructors so that they can teach vocational training like plumbing, carpenting much more, ergo, this will help them to gain skills and start new life. To add on, problems in getting employment is the salient reason why criminals execute more offences, in other words, culprits find it difficult to restart their life in society because of their bad image among people, due to this they are unable to find appropriate job and this pursue them to perform more criminal activities, to tackle it, government should create more employment for these people and also impose high penalties to disencourage offenders, consequently, it will prevent wrongdoers from committing more crimeAll in all, although immates influence and trouble in searching employment are prime reasons to do crime again and again, however, it cam be solved by hiring instructors and generating employment",No,No,No,No,No,Yes,5.5
The two figure below show the rate of criminal convictions among men and women of diferent age,"These two figures below indicate the proportion of criminal convictions among men and women of different ages in the Uk and rate of male and female prisoners in the British prison system

In second figure, there was a similar among the raise, the highest and the decrease in the rate of age of offender. The proportion of offender at the age of ten to fifteen tends to increase significantly and reach the highest rate at the age of 20 in both male and female percentage of conviction, 16% at male and 5% at female. In contrast, the rate of both genre decrease heavily at the age of 20 to 60, from 5% to 0% at women and from 16% to 2% at men.

"criminal behavior has genetic cause/others belives that circumstance leads to committing a crime. discuss both views and give your opinion,","crime is not inherent, it is highly affected by the environment and influence of a society, group, or even by a person.

misdeed is not a trait that transfer through chromosome, it is an idea or a habit that slowly grows in a human being

because of the moral value or information, one is getting from the outer world alone.

we humans have a habit of learning things and are very quick in it, some know the difference between right and wrong,

can filter while others consume everything they can observe in day-to-day activities. For example; a child who grew

in a rich family and a street orphan kid has different circumstances. A hungry child, a greedy human, and even an angry animal

may cause a lot of damage to society and cause a lot of criminal activities. Each with a different skill set and ethics, on the other hand

Children do generally follow the older footsteps, that is a genetic habit. If they see any of their family members convicted of

any crimes they do have the same kind of mindset and also get into some kind of evil works from the younger age and as well as influence

other younger members of the family or friends, eventually, the one rotten apple will decay the whole caret. moreover, some genes and

enzymes present in the body from their parents make people more aggressive, as a habit is a heredity a genetic cause.

Some people believe that criminal should be put into prison as long as possible however others believe that its right to education those people in local communities with both sides and give your opinion,"Many people argue that criminals should be punished into jail as much as possible, whilst rest of believe that convict should get education for remaining life to live in society. I completely agree with both statements and this essay describe that the main idea about statements.

Firstly, nowadays many human turning to crime due to poverty and unemployment. Many of them do minor robbery, but there was someone who try to kill someone, kidnap and physical assault. For these types of prisoners government should take a higher step and gave them more and more punishment, so they have built fear about this to not do this again. Also authorities should gave them daily dose of torture and doing brainwash of fugitive. For example, in India there was a law passed last year that anyone do rape to opposite gender they have penalty of sentance of death.

Secondly, there are many convict who become bad person for some reason, so they need just good education moreover, many of them are doing crime just for food and money or for some basic things. However, these types of criminal caught they should not be punished. For instance, in the America there is a school where these types of criminal are deployed from different area of world where they can learn some basic education. In addition, in this school on Sunday, or on holiday picnic was organised, so this is better place to live for criminal after some years they were free with their families.

In conclusion, for some reason punishment was necessary. As well as education is also a good way for make a future bright, this will help them for a new start of life.",Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,7
Is prison the best way to punish criminals?,"There has been an increase in the crime rate in recent years. While many argue that imprisonment is the best penalty for criminals in terms of social safety and educating the next generations, I believe that there are numerous alternative punishments such as community services or fines.

On the one hand, one of the main advantages of imprisoning criminals is that the others may feel much safer. Indeed, if the government does not send offenders to jail, especially those who committed felonies, people might usually worry about surrounding people, which leads to their life satisfaction decrease. Moreover, schools and parents can use that evidence to educate their children to avoid committing crimes. Undoubtedly, children probably do not engage in any evil action if they recognize that they will receive corresponding penalties.

However, there are plenty of substitute solutions that likely have better effects. First, criminals can be advantageous for the community by participating in social services such as forestation, helping the elderly, or improving remote areas' environments. They can also be aware of their public roles and social responsibilities, then become better and profitable people after being released. Furthermore, being jailed is not suitable for those who offended petty crimes. For example, fining a person who parked his car wrongly is a better punishment than sending him to prison.

In conclusion, sending criminals to prisons is a reasonable penalty for community security and educational reasons. Nevertheless, several alternatives are more proper for minor crimes, such as social services or fines. ",Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,7
Some people believe that police should use guns to control criminals while others think that guns should not be used. to what extent do you agree or disagree,"The population growth, booming economy and rapid urbanization in today's world cause the rise of crime with sophisticated forms of crime and modern weapons. People have different views of whether police should be armed with guns. From my perspective, gun is an indispensable weapon in combating crimes.

On one hand, the widespread use of guns among the police may rise the risk of accidents in crowded places. For instance, police officers who force carries guns can lose control and shoot an unarmed criminal or an innocent person which lead to unexpected casualties. To deal with this problem, instead of using guns, police can use many alternatives such as tear gas, sprays and electric shock weapons. Another solution is to allow only special police units who have to face with armed offenders.

On the other hand, I strongly agree that police should be armed with guns to ensure security for the people. Criminals are becoming increasingly dangerous with modern weapons that require police officers to be well armed. In many cases, shooting is the best choice at the time. For example, police need to use guns when they are attacked by dangerous criminals in self-defense. Furthermore, to prevent dangerous criminals from escaping which may cause threats to the safety of the public, shooting is the most reasonable choice for the police. It cannot be denied that, the threat of a gun can arrest criminals and avoid physical violence. With guns, police officers can force a criminal to surrender quickly, reduce the panic for surrounding people.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that police should be well-equipped with guns due to the increasing level of armed criminals.",No,No,Yes,No,No,No,5.5
It is considered by some that giving prison sentences to criminals isn't more effective than using education and job training,"It is considered by some that giving prison sentences to criminals isn't more effective than using education and job training. In my own thinking, I partly agree with this statement due to the practicality of the two actions.

On the one hand, I do believe that sending criminals to prison is necessary. On top of all, the people who are unlawful need punishments as consequences for their crimes. That not only brings fairness but also a deterrent for those who have a high-risk offender. Besides that, innocents will get the feeling of safety if the criminals go to jail and can't threaten their life. That will help decline plenty of serious problems definitely occur in society when the rate of crimes swiftly shoots up.

On the other hand, giving forgiveness to people who have awareness of their wrong acts in the past is essential as well. Instead of being kept in prison, criminals should be given chances to create positive values for the community. It's never too late for a second life so moral education and job training will be considered as salvation. One another reason for this statement to be a great idea is the respect of human rights. There is no need for physical punishments but a change in cognition. To make sure they will not make mistakes, criminals should be supported to distinguish between right and wrong than being lost freedom. In conclusion, going to jail is a suitable punishment for criminals but education and job training plays an important role as well",No,No,No,No,No,No,5.5
"Presently, as the crime rate continues to increase, the method to keep criminals also becomes a problem which there are more and more people pay attention to. From my point of view,","Presently, as the crime rate continues to increase, the method to keep criminals also becomes a problem which there are more and more people pay attention to. From my point of view, I completely agree with the idea that "" Education and job training should be used instead of sending criminals to prison"".

Despite opposite opinions, I do not doubt that education and training job brings to us a wide range of benefits. First of all, education and job training can contribute to enhancing criminals' awareness. It also helps them to distinguish between right and wrong. Furthermore, this approach provides lawbreakers with enough knowledge to get a good job after being released from prison. Most of the criminals are lack general knowledge and uneducated that is the reason why all companies and factories turn down them, thus job training can encourage them to have experiences and morals for a permanent job. Last but not least, not only does this method help them to have a job, but it also brings to criminals respect. Without any violence, education and job training make criminals recognize that they also have a personal value that needs to be promoted, which also benefits society.

Definitely, keeping criminals in prison brings to us a lot of drawbacks. Firstly, sending criminals to prison costs a certain period of money. To assure the safety of the locals and no escape, facilities and structures need to be improved and built solidly. In addition, life in prison impact criminals' mental strength negatively. Prison having many strict and violent regulations make detainees not patient and feel unsatisfied, therefore, some of them continue to do unlawful act after being released.

"It is often argued modern society people think that penalty for murder case is not a way to punish a murderer.However, many people says death punishment is must for the criminals who killed a person. this essay will examine both pros and cons.","people believe death penalty for a person who killed someone or who did a crime is predominantly accepted because that only can reduce crime activities. in addition, strict rules are only make a peaceful environment. The compaigners teaching a lot of advice to the people who doing bad activities but that they are not allowed to their ear to listen, they again and again doing this kind of crimes. Moreover, if the government once give a murder punishment, it will not happen again. For example, most of local villages still doing some own their rules to punish, the criminal who are doing murder these only can stop that bad behaviour.

Government have a burden of the Prisoners . criminals after freeing from the Jails again do crimes in society. Is prison work? Criminals should be rehabilitated or punished?,"In this model era, crimes are increasing at alarming rate. However, lawmakers enforce new rules to restrict the crimes. It is reckoned that, in several places, lockups are overpopulated and difficult for government to maintain. When criminals are released from the jail, they again do crimes and end up back in prisons. Lawbreakers be rehabilitated rather than putting them again in the prison. This essay will discuss the reason for this notion and working of prisons. To commence with, in the current days, jails are full of offenders. However, jails are not working accurately because lots of amenities are provided in the prison for the Prisoners. Even, the restrictions in lockups are of lower level, which are easier for them to follow. Moreover, prisoners do not have any realisation about their crimes, which show the inability of the lock up to make lawbreakers regret about their doings. Overall, prisons are unable to tackle with the offenders. Moving to another aspect, there is great burden on the shoulder of government to maintain the facilities and discipline in the jails. Consequently, rehabilitation is a vital aspect to reduce the maintenance of prisons and funds of government that are used for providing the facilities to prisoners. Before releasing the Prisoners, they should be guided by the authorities. In other words, government should provide necessary education and practical skill which lead them to become a responsible person in a society. In addition, prisoners should be introduced to practical skills before releasing from Jails because if they have knowledge of practical work like carpentry and electric technician then they have job opportunities in the society. As a result income source could be opted after rehabilitation by offenders. This led to distract the criminal to again perform crimes. Moreover, prisoners should be educated about humanity and rules of the society which helped them to co-operate with the society. As a result, they become responsible citizen and they can follow the path of goodness. This will lead to to reduce the count of criminals who do crime after releasing from prison. To sum up, prisons are provided for the betterment of the Prisoners. But the basic education is needed to offenders to realise their mistake, this improvement is mandatory in the prisons",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,5
"Nowadays, criminals commit crime for the second time as soon as they are released","When perpetrators free from jail, they are committing another crime. In my opinion, the government should introduce practical and rehabilitation courses in prison and society also accept culprit and especially employers should not avoid to hire convicted persons. This essay will not only highlight the problem but also present some sollutions to resolve it.

Firsly, the reason for re-offending is that nations do not pay attention criminals. Prisons are a place where criminals congregate and influence each other poorly, while should be a place where offenders can understand bad effect of their behaviours to themselves and society with help of psychological support and gain new habits that can help them find employment after conviction. Secondly, the attitude toward ex-convicts by the individuals is not right at all. Although every person deserve a second chance, society do not believe that prisoners can change. This makes it tough for perpetrators to inhabit among people, find work and live as human being. These factors leave ex-convicts no choice but to break a law.

Nevertheless, solutions exist to combat this potentially dangerous problem. The solution should start with criminals must be encouraged to rehabilitation programs to avoid anti-social attitude. At the result, those programs should help them make the right choices in society. Moreover, governments should provide new employments for prisoners. Because the main problem of criminals is not having money to live, and this is the main reason they commit crimes. If job opportunities are provided to them, we will eliminate the main reason for them to commit crimes again.

In conclusion, the problem of committing crimes again by ex-convicts will hardly be solved unless necessary measures are taken by rehabilitation courses during conviction and new job opportunities. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,5.5
"""Can sentences passed by judges not only punish criminals but rehabilitate them and integrate into community?""","I strongly believe that sentences passed by judges not only punish criminals but rehabilitate them and integrate them into the community. People committed crimes are usually more vulnerable to do it due to the lack of education, being abused, having mental issues, living in poor conditions, having low social responsibility, and many other circumstances. Though they are criminals and needed to be punished they stay people and have the right to be integrated into the community. The easiest way to do it is through imprisonment.

The first idea is that prisons have several major purposes. The primary aim is that criminals achieve punishment. Depriving them of their freedom is a way of making them pay a debt to society for their crimes. However, criminals are also removed from society so that they can no longer harm innocent people. Moreover, it prevents them from future crimes. It is hoped that prisons provide warnings to people thinking about committing crimes and that the possibility of going to prison will discourage people from breaking the law. Furthermore, the prison has a rehabilitation function add it implies changing criminals into law-abiding citizens and may include providing educational courses in prison, teaching job skills, and offering counseling with a psychologist or social worker.

So the second idea is that criminals can be given such possibilities that were not available for them in normal life. Having an education in prison has a positive impact. More than half of people are rearrested in the first year after release. But for those prisoners who participate in prison education programs, it is unlikely. It gives a person the chance to feel human again, to feel that they are not worse than others and that have the right to normal life. When people have a chance to see what is possible for their future, then hope can turn even the darkest night into something bright and productive.

The last but not least, people in prison can participate in different social programs, the main goal of which is to help such people find their place in society. Moreover, criminals have the opportunity to be given psychological help. That’s can help them to work on traumas and put into order their lives. Improving the mental health of inmates can give them the realization of how to live after and even while imprisoned.

To sum up, everything that has been stated, the sentence for imprisoning has different functions and one of them is rehabilitation function through giving opportunities to receive education and psychological help. ",No,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5
It is commonly seen that criminals reoffend the crime once they are set free from jails.why does it happen? What can be done to resolve the issue?,"Criminals activities are increasing day by day in all over the world. Umpteen of initiative are being done by goverment to control these activities but all these approaches proved to be futile as it did not yield any positive results. Nevertheless, it is seen that when criminals get free from prison they reoffend the crime. This essay will not only discuss cause behind this but also certain measures to mitigate the issue will be shared.

Intiating with most salient reason why crime is being done by offenders again and again, it is because they have lack of money to fullfil their daily needs. To explicate it, when criminals commit crime regularly, thier image in society get spoil as well as due to criminal record they find very difficultly to get job, since nobody trust them and Owing to unemployment they become financially weak and they are not able to earn their livelihood. For instance, criminals also have families to feed and to live decent life, which is not possible without money: therefore, lack of money leads the to commit crime again.

Although elminating crime completely is not possible, some some solution can aid to reduce this problem, goverment must make efforts to support released criminals financially. To elaborate itz government should provide them monthly grant and certain type of work so they can get a decent amount of pay to fullfil their daily needs. For example, Ukraine has the lowest crime rates in world, the reason behind they confer some jobs to released prisoners like doing cooking in prison and garden work, these jobs make them wise person in society and financially stable. Consequently, in this way the crime reoffended by criminals can be controlled.

In conclusion, the people who do crime are mostly uneducated, so goverment should provide them proper education and also motivate them to get education.",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6.5
Recent study suggests that the majority of the criminals who sent to the persion after they are reiesed crime why is this case what can done to zolve the problem,"It is irrefutable that crime rates are upsurging by leaps and bounds due to which It is believed by few indivodual in today's times majority of criminals move to jail and after that do crime go out the prison. Now I will discuss some resons and solution mitigate the issues in forthcoming paragraphs. There are ample of reasons why criminals do crime after go out the jail. To begin with, nowadays, the crime rates are increasing dayby day because in these days there are many expensive things in all over the world such as education and medical services so many individuals do crime because they can earn good money for the crime then they can provid fulfill need their famil members. In addition, recent time unemployed are exorbitanting day by day because nowadays there are many works in the country depend on machine as machine are very faster work rather than human beings. On the other hand, there are some solution mitigate the grave issues. First and foremost, government should provid the education about vocational work for criminals because criminals move their home from jails. it is efficient way to earn money for these work. Moreover, the another solution is that government should provide many jobs opportunities for criminals because criminals are not educated and move their homes from jail after that they have no any work in their life then they do crime. So that there are some solution m8tigate the issue. To conclusion, I would like to reiterate that if authority can provide many opportunities like Jobs, education and other also then the crime rates declined day by day. ",No,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5
Capital punishment given to criminals to control crime rate. To what extent you agree,"Nowadays, crime rate is increasing day by day that’s why masses feel insecure and without capital punishment criminals are rising. In my opinion, On the whole i agree but i have some reservations about the death penalty.

To commence with, population is rising and the desires of humans also. Some of the individual get involved in crime and few of the crime should not be ignored by the government like terrorism because it include mass murdring most of the innocent people die also, the rapist should be punished by the death penalty. There are also such type of crime in which only the captial punishment is necessary to set example for the criminals, who do crimes like human trafficking and molestation of adolescents. For instance kabus like terrorist",No,No,No,No,No,Yes,5.5
"In recent decades, criminals have been a controversial topic. Whereas there is a school of thought about the negative impact of prison sentences as well as the necessity of education and job training, personally","In recent decades, criminals have been a controversial topic. Whereas there is a school of thought about the negative impact of prison sentences as well as the necessity of education and job training, personally, I approve of this sentimentRE and repercussions surrounding this issue will be analyzed in detail.

On the one hand, it is understandable why sending defenders to prisons is absolutely worse. The main justification is that the material and spiritual values of prisoners are not authorized. In the other words, the establishment of a jail together with facilities is prohibitively expensive, which puts a strain on government coffers. Therefore, the president came into force with new legislation cutting prison living expenses irrespective of violator’s demands. According to New York’s News in 2020, a host of deaths came from low-tech accommodation for offenders in this state. This is the testament to a grudge against prison.

On the other hand, I am convinced that education as well as job cultivating plays a pivotal role. It is definitely clear that this method facilitates deterrent occupation. This activity is synonymous with the fact that crimers can equip themselves with basic knowledge and enrich life experiences. Those lay the foundations for lawbreakers to earn living after setting free. Moreover, education is the key factor to enhance people's awareness. No matter how bad they were, they can stand a chance of being good citizens thanks to education. This puts an emphasis on the importance of education and job joining in such a poor accommodation like prisons. ",No,No,No,No,No,No,5.5
"IN SOME COUNTRIES, THE CRIMINAL TRIALS ARE SHOWN ON TV AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC CAN WATCH THEM. DO THE DISADVANTAGE OUTWEIGH THE ADVANTAGES?","It is true that there are a trend in showing court trial on broad for the majority to watch which caused many controversies. Despite the obvious disadvantages of broadcasting criminal trials on television, I would argue that this are outweighed by its advantages.

On the one hand, there are two majors benefits when broadcasting trial publicly which could be beneficial to the society. The first and foremost is this could set an example for the majority in order to give warning about the severity of the consequence. This leads to people being feared and have a tendency to avoid committing in any crime, as a result it would decrease the crime rate. Another positive impact of this is the rise in awareness of the majority about the surrounding. By showing the latest criminal trials to the public they could raise awareness, therefore they could be well-prepared for any unanticipated situations. Consequently, by allowing general public to have access to criminal trials it could leads to many advantages.

On the other hand, criminal trials which used to be exclusive for only people with authority are now being accessible to public could be a great source of references for amateurs lawyers. In most case, students do not have a sufficient amount of resources for research and this could be use as case study. For instance, inexperienced lawyers could use the technique during the court to help defend their customers. Consequently, this could widen their knowledge and improve their performances. In addition, with the agreement of the government to publicize criminal trials they could do research on residents opinions about current regulations. This could greatly reflects to the sastifaction to the current regulations and how residence abide the rules. Therefore, the Government could have a suitable and adaptable visions and method of developing.

In conclusion, it is undeniable to say that the criminal trials are shown on televison and be accessible to the general publics has its drawbacks. Hence, it seems to that it is the advantageous of its are completely outweigh its disadvantages.",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6
‘Cannabis has been classified as a Class B drug in the UK since 2008 and carries a prison sentence of up to five years for possession. ( Source : The Week ) Many countries have decriminalized the use of cannabis and as a result have seen a reduction in drug related crime. Should cannabis and other soft drugs use be legalized ? Give reasons for your answer and Include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience .,"In the last decade, drug related crimes increased. To deal with the situation, many countries have legalized cannabis and other soft drugs and reported a positive result. In my opinion, cannabis and other soft drugs should be legalized because drug addicts collect these drugs someway or other. Besides legalizing these drugs will reduce drug related crimes.

Drug addicts do not consider whether it is legal or illegal when buying drugs. Hence, legalizing or not legalizing soft drugs will have little or no effect on their drug consumption. So, it is better to legalize these drugs and regulate the market and track all the drug related transactions. This way government can earn revenue as well as reduce drug related crimes. Besides, criminal groups often fight against each other because of drugs which often lead to murder even. For example, in Bangladesh cannabis and other soft drugs are banned but drug addicts manage these drugs illegally which often causes unwanted occurences. If they can collect drugs legally from authorized stores, they will have no reason to fight for drugs. In addition, illegal drugs often contain poisonous elements which lead to death. Considering all these factors, cannabis and other soft drug consumption should be decriminalised.

However, a group of people believe that legalizing soft drugs will destroy our young generation. They are of the belief that young people will be inspired to try out these drugs if these are readily available in the local market. This may result in an increase of drug addicts and drug related crimes according to them. Development think, if properly regulated, legalizing soft drugs will cause no such issues. For example, everyone has not become smokers although cigarette is legal.

To conclude, it is not so difficult to collect drugs even if it is illegal. Therefore, it is better to legalize soft drugs like cannabis as it may result in reduction of drug related crimes death for taking drugs that contains poisonous elements. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,5.5
Some ex-prisoners commit crimes again after they are released from prison. What do you think is the cause? How can it be solved?,"It is seen that some ex-convicts break the laws again after being released from jail. There are several factors leading to this fact and it could be easily addressed with certain solutions.

On the one hand, it stands to the reason why some ex-convicts tend to go back to the path of crimes. Firstly, they are struggling with their new life after being released from jail. They have to grapple against prejudice from society just because they used to be a criminal. They are able to be denied by recruiters, rendering it difficult for them to find a new job. As a consequence, they would be unemployed and not have opportunities to gain money that would lead to their illegal acts again. Secondly, they have a lack of education about the law. They could not recognize their illegal behavior, which may cause negative results for many innocents. For instance, to afford their life’s demands, they tend to steal money from people.  On the other hand, it could be solved by practical solutions. To begin with, the government should encourage recruiters to have a better outlook to create more job opportunities for ex-convicts who want to fix their mistakes. By doing this, it would provide them with support that may help them to return to the community. Moreover, the ex-criminals need to be supplied with moral training. Joining moral training may supply them with a better understanding of moral behavior which would improve their comprehension. For instance, organizing moral classes twice a week for ex-convicts would help them have enough knowledge about conforming laws.

To sum up, there are some major catalysts as specified above that have sparked a burgeoning reason that criminals tend to commit crimes again. People involved are recommended to take immediate action to retrieve the best outcome.",No,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5
Moose Judiciary systems rely on Correctional Facilities that provide a second chance to criminals to reflect on their past deeds and change their social attitudes.,"Moose Judiciary systems rely on Correctional Facilities that provide a second chance to criminals to reflect on their past deeds and change their social attitudes. Some believe that those who use this chance wisely and take corrective measures in their life decisions might actually be the best people to advise teenagers not to walk down that path. While to some certain degree it is true, I believe more often than not, it might prove ineffective.

It is acceptable that then criminals -now normal citizens- have some certain experience that might be useful to pass on to the next generation. after all, they understand what it is about crime and committing them that might appeal to younger Generations' taste. We're having this knowledge they can communicate better and address how futile some urges are. For instance, shoplifting is common among adolescents and if not the ultimate correctly could lead to more drastic crimes. Now, if it is explained to Young criminals that the pleasure they might gain from shoplifting is only temporary and could lead to more problematic consequences, there's a chance that they might Heed These words.

On the other hand, there are flaws in letting teenagers and then criminals talk. First of all, teenagers might get the wrong idea that there is always a way back and there will always be time to change for the better, which in reality is not true, but they might not comprehend is that it is not true too many other criminals for whom it is too late to turn back. Furthermore, it is not easy talking to a young rebellious person, because their minds are set and changing it is not easy. Plus, consider the fact that teenagers consider themselves Superior to all timers, so no matter how hard one tries to give them advice, they only consider this person simply ""too dumb that got caught, that would not be me"".

In conclusion, I think people who live from the time they spend in prison are not the ideal character who could guide the Young. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6.5
"Once a person become a criminal, he will always be a criminal. agree or disagree","Some people are of the opinion that when someone is convicted of a certain crime, they will invariably be a perpetrator. In my opinion, it depends on individuals whether they change themselves or continue breaking the law.

When it comes to people who keep committing crime, some of them are affected by many factors that make them continue being a criminal. Some perpetrators’ behaviors can be linked to their genes, which means those criminal behaviors can be caused by biological factors. Therefore, although some perpetrators were jailed for a certain period of time, they might still commit crime because of their nature. To illustrate, a couple who live in my neighborhood are fraudsters and they were arrested several times. Their son was also convicted of many types of crimes such as fraud and drug smuggling. Although he was sentenced to prison many times, it seems that there is no improvement in his behavior. What is more, perpetrators who live in crime-ridden areas tend to reoffend their crime since they are affected by their living environment in a negative way. This situation is quite true as they are surrounded and deeply influenced by a wide range of bad people who have serious criminal records.

On the other hand, in some situations, criminals may not become a law breaker a second time. First, people who unintentionally commit a crime may not reoffend the crime again. These people commit crime because they lack knowledge of law or the crime is beyond their control. For example, a content creator on social media used music from a number of websites to insert to her videos without knowing that those musics are in copyright and she was sued for using the music without the permission of the composers. Since then, she was more careful with choosing music for her videos and less likely to reoffend that crime again. Second, rehabilitation changes criminals into law-abiding citizens. When criminals are provided education courses in prison, they are taught job skills and offered counseling. This enables them to find a legal job when they are released so they can make a living and feed themselves. Once their lives are stable, they may not tend to commit crime again.

To conclude, I believe it depends on each individual in certain situations whether a perpetrator will continue being a criminal or not. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,5.5
Major environmental problem,"Many people think that the loss of particular plants and animal species is the major environmental problem that humans are facing nowadays, while others believe that some environmental issues are more alarming. I agree with the latter view and will analyze both views in the following essay.

On the one hand, the loss of animal and plant species is considered a main environmental problem because of its impact on our planet’s biodiversity. Around the world, trees are being cut down for industrial and agricultural purposes. As a result, there will not be enough trees to produce oxygen for humans and prevent the soil from washing away. Meanwhile, endangered animals are being poached to serve people’s needs, hence negatively affecting the whole ecosystem. For example, when sharks are killed for their fins, many types of aquatic species no longer have their natural predators to control their population. Consequently, the disappearance of predators disrupts the natural food chain and then leads to unbalanced underwater ecosystems.

On the other hand, there are more urgent environmental issues that exist aside from the loss of plant and animal species. Those problems including pollution and climate change are the main factors that cause the loss of biodiversity and put the natural habitat on the brink of destruction. Water and soil pollution caused by industrial and agricultural activities are poisoning a large number of species of marine and land animals, which means that human health is also negatively affected as those animals are humans’ important food source. Moreover, changing weather patterns caused by climate change lead to more frequent occurrences of natural disasters such as droughts, floods, and wildfires.

In conclusion, the loss of particular plants and animals should indeed be paid great attention to, but other environmental issues should also be taken into consideration. I think we should put a great deal of effort into tackling all of those problems rather than only focusing on the animals and plants’ extinction. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6.5
The availability of cheap air travel is giving more and more ordinary people the opportunity to travel worldwide. Environmentalists claim that this is leading to global warming. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Write at least 250 words.,"Cheap air travelling seems to be a gatekeeper for travelling paradise nowadays. However, in my opinion air travelling payment should be increased because it will lead to development of local tourism and decrease burden on environment as well.

Although I understand the arguments about travelling abroad, I cannot fully agree with them. In my opinion, there is no better place than home. It makes no difference wether people live in tropical climat or in cold surrounding. Higher costs make people to concentrate on routes that are more available. And this consequently could maintain local tourism economic and contribute to thrift of home region.

Another reason why air prices should be higher is that aircraft emissions are released high in the atmosphere and they have a potent climate impact, triggering chemical reactions and atmospheric effects that heat the planet. Resent researches declare that the global tourism industry is responsible for eight per cent of global emissions — more than the construction industry. Moreover, the total carbon impact of a single flight is so high that avoiding just one trip can be equivalent to going car-free for a year.

In conclusion I would like to emphasize that a rise of air travelling prices are reasonable and sensible because it leads to environmental conservation",No,No,No,No,No,No,5.5
The environmental problems that today's world is facing are so great that there is little ordinary people can do to improve the situation .so government and large organisations should be responsible for reducing the amount of damage being done to the environment to what extent do you agree or disagree.,"It is often considered that, of late, environment issues have become pressing problem nowadays. As per the stated notion, authorities, large firms and manufactures can play a fundamental role in reversing the harmful damages done to the environment while ordinary people have little to contribute. It has been prevailing a significant concern in all over the world. The following paragraphs would elucidate why we should protect our surroundings.

To embark on, there are major concerns why environment problems are augmenting day by day. First and foremost, In the contemporary world global warming is increasing significantly which is considered having had a detrimental effect on both the individual and society. For instance, due to this climatic condition could affect in the era. Thus, it builds up high walls around the environment which puts them in fettle.

On the other hand, it is generally believe that individuals could protect our environment and they should be responsible for this. On a wider spectrum, by introducing green balconies, understanding will strengthen their ability. For instance, ranging from recycled materials to renewable resources for sustainable development. Hence, one day environment issues would predominant over all world.

To recapitulate, by doing this it will help them reintegrate back into society and give them some means of support, I strongly agree forms and all people should be responsible since it would reap the benefits of globalisation. ",No,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5
Global warming is one of the biggest threat to our environment.what causes global warming? What solutions are there to solve this problem?,"In recent years global warming is one of the pressing problem that our environment is facing. The principal cause behind this phenomenon is air pollution and deforestation. However the same can be curbed by using alternative sources of energy and planting more trees. Fundamentally, there are two prominent reasons that can attributed to the increase in global warming. Primary reason is the air pollution caused by public and private transportation. With the increasing number of vehicles which releases harmful gases like carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and methane in the air, these greenhouse gases are the major source of increasing temperature of earth which ultimately results in global warming. Secondly, another reason that contribute to the global warming is deforestation the cutting of the trees leads to release of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. One mature tree absorb as much as 48 pounds of carbon dioxide each year. For example, according to American scientific research, deforestation is responsible for 15 percent of the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Although, there are plenty of ways to solve this problem by taking some possible measures with the coalition of the public and authorities. Chiefly, the public ought to use CNG powered vehicles as natural gas regarded as clear fuel. Government should implement laws to minimize the adoption of current vehicles. For example, in many developed countries number of vehicles decreased and petroleum energy is replaced by CNG. Secondly, as a way to tackle this issue the authority could make the law to protect the remaining forests and new schemes should be placed to promote the planting of trees. Furthermore, government should also launch awareness programs to protect the forest. In conclusion, although the world is suffering from the hazards of increased global warming because of the inclined carbon content in the air and loss of green trees, while the same can be tackled by introducing natural gas over petroleum and by protecting trees. If the state implemented these solutions, the problem can be reduced to a manageable level. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,5
Most people do not care enough about environmental issues. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"A majority of people do not pay attention to the increasing environmental problems. In my opinion, the environment does play a major role in one’s life but unfortunately, most of the people arround us do not pay attention to it.

Global warming is a major issue which has been left ignored over the years and is now impacting our lives badly. A vast variety of people are unaware of the term global warming, its causes as well as its solutions. The extremes of the temperature that we are facing nowadays is a result of this increasing global warming whose major cause is deforestation, which can be resolved simply by promoting trees implantation but little effort has been put into this matter. ,

Another reason of this ignorance towards our surroundings is that most of the people are unaware of the significance of environmental issues and have no idea what these problems can lead to. A survey conducted in Toronto in 2010, shows that 70% of the people were unaware of the tern environmental issues and were subsequently unaware of its causes Iif people are made aware of the term environment and the importance of keeping safe surroundings than we can surely tackle these problems over a little period of time.

In my point of view, although these environmental issues are affecting our day to day life but only a few people are aware of it. A little effort can resolve these issues, by highlighting the importance of a clean and healthy environment. The conductance of seminars and teaching environmental sciences in schools and universities can increase the awareness in people regarding this issue and thus can lead to a better and safe environment.

The biggest concern in today’s world is pollution and environmental waste.,"The biggest concern in today’s world is pollution and environmental waste. As countries are progressing and become wealthier environmental problem are growing day by day which cannot be neglected. I totally agree with statement.

First of all, in developing countries pollution is the main problem for the atmosphere. To become richer state, country depend on their industries which eventually create the industrial waste. Moreover, poor infrastructure also cause not only ecological but also effect the healthy environment. For instance, a research is conducted by university of Mumbai, 60% of total environmental issues is created by industries which include pollution and other toxic waste.

Secondly, the effect of pollution and environmental issue on human health is so dangerous that it cannot be avoided. The smog atmosphere generated the toxics in air which increase the diseases of lung and throat. Moreover, it not only effect humans but other species on this planet. In last few years, we have seen that large number of dead fishes are coming on shore of oceans around the world. This situations become the eye opener for decision maker of developing countries. For example, in mid 90s London face the smoky and fog weather which effects the health of senior citizen and children. Eventually, this weather cost many lives which makes the policy maker and other streak holder to think about this and takes major steps to dispose the industrial wastage as well the air pollution.

To conclude this, we can only overcome the pollution and environmental is to create the eco-friendly environment. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,5.5
Developed countries have created environmental problems in the world particularly in their contribution to global warming what can be done to reduce the dangers of global warming,"Environmental pollution has enormously increased throughout the world. Developing countries have generated environmental issues specifically in their endowment to global warming. In order to get rid of global warming we should use renewable energy resources. Firstly, there is no doubt that developing countries have increased the risk of global warming to the extent levels. For instance a large number of industries which are running in the developing countries have polluted the atmosphere. While some human activities such as greenhouse effect plays a key role in this regard. Green house gases trap the solar radiations in the atmosphere which results as the increased temperature of the environment across the globe. Secondly, public transport such as cars, buses, motorcycles are also sweltering the environment. Take for example these vehicles release carbon dioxide and methane gases which are adding to the atmosphere. Due to this weather conditions are constantly changing. overall climate climate of the world is becoming more worsen due to the severe conditions such as hot and cold. However due to the severity of hot weather the ice caps are melting which might causes flooding because of the rise in the sea level. Moreover burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas are proved to be a final nail in the coffin in raising the global warmth. Conversely, I think certain crucial measures should be taken by both the government and the masses in order to reduce the global warming. Initially the regime should impose taxes on the industries which mostly cause global warming and warned them to use the alternative sources of fossil fuels. The second step in this regard is that developing countries must rely upon natural resources such as solar energy, tidal energy from seas and oceans as a substitute to those sources which cause pollution in the environment. By obeying and practicing all these measures we might overcome this cause of climate change. To recapitulate, developing countries should strive to exclude the dangers of global warming by using renewable resources, otherwise it would be difficult for us to live on this planet due to extreme weather conditions.

Traffic increases pollution. Pollution increases health issues. Give arguments that increasing fuel prices is better solution for this or not and give your solutions/suggestions.,"Traffic, pollution and health are progressively linked to each other. While overpriced petrol rates have decreased traffic and thus pollution, the rise in health problems has not halted. The main issues arising are cardiovascular and respiratory. While there are many possible solutions, increasing fuel prices is far and away the least efficient of them.

To begin with, increased gasoline prices especially in underdeveloped countries is only putting more pressure on the individuals and the economy. Even though some people start using public transport instead of personal conveyance which decreases pollution in theory, the majority of population remains unaffected. On the contrary, the health issues like hypertension remain unresolved as it is also directly related to the stress put on people due to expensive fuel. It is evident from an American survey which shows little to no improvement in the percentage of hypertensive individuals after employing such technique.

Similarly, respiratory problems like asthma, COPD, allergy and bronchogenic carcinoma are undoubtedly exacerbated owing to increased quantity of pollutants shoved into the atmosphere. On paper, increased prices should decrease traffic and pollution, and consequently such airway abnormalities but statistics say otherwise. A research was done to show that there was insignificant improvement in overall respiratory disorders even after doubling the fuel cost per liter over 2 years.

The solutions to these problems require changes at national scale. Firstly, pollution can be decreased with promotion of electric cars as this has no contradictory effect on health. Secondly, public transport quality should be improved to make people choose public transport over personal conveyance. Their ticket prices should also be kept in check. Lastly, old cars that are overused should be kept out of the system as they produce relatively more toxic substances. All these solutions are one time investments with long lasting effects that are necessary to stop further problems from developing.",No,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5
"Tourism today creates a variety of problems, such as pollution due to flights, transport and dirty water. Do you think that governments should impose extra taxes on flights or accommodation to restrict today’s tourism industry? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience","Travelling today is simple to the extent that within twelve hours one can travel from Europe to Singapore, crossing nearly the whole globe. Based on this simplicity, tourism has changed significantly over the years. While in the past a family would be proud to drive two hours to a lake, many families now think nothing of travelling to the far side of the world. This also has a downside as increased pollution is a result. Extra taxes on flights or accommodation have therefore been offered as a solution so as to increase the cost of tourism and reduce its popularity.

No matter what major transportation is used, travelling creates pollution. To decrease the amount of pollution caused by tourism, the tourism industry itself would have to be weakened. If these increased taxes are based on travelling distance, people would be more willing to stay closer to their home country, as for many even a slight increase would mean that their planned holidays would be too expensive. Accommodation taxes would raise holiday costs no matter the distance travelled. Therefore, if increased taxes were levied on travel and accommodation, tourism and therefore pollution would decrease.

On the other hand, the main transport methods that would be impacted by imposing extra taxes would be communal ones, such as planes, trains and buses, and increasing the taxes would also impact non-tourists. Also, holidays are a vital part of ordinary people’s lives, as they escape from work and stress, and get to spend valuable time with their families. Stopping people travelling would greatly impact some simple pleasures of ordinary life.

In conclusion, while tourism impacts the environment significantly, simply introducing extra taxes on transport or accommodation is a drastic measure. It could be more valuable to change the methods of transportation to decrease pollution, instead making people stay close to home. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6
"Air traffic is increasingly leading to more noise, pollution, and airport construction. One reason for this is the growth in low-cost passenger flights, often to holiday destinations. Some people say that government should try to reduce air traffic by taxing it more heavily. Do you agree or disagree?","According to a recent survey conducted there has been a substantial increase in the amount of air traffic all around the world repercussion in distinct obstacles, furthermore a leading cause of this has been the growth of low-cost airlines. Although some people think that the key to solving these issues should be higher taxes for air travel. In my opinion, I completely disagree that it is the best way to tackle these stuffs.

Firstly, dealing with the issues surrounding pollution, noise and construction is not best solved by raising taxes. It will directly affect lower-class people. They will not travel as much as they did before due to inability to afford tickets an example to illustrate this point is some of them will be broken their promise to take their children to popular ski resort because of the sharp rise of taxes. Additionally, the inequalities between humans will be raised consequently it may make them feel humiliated and discontented with the aviation industry.

Secondly, from both an economic and cultural perspectives, tourism is the best source of revenue for host country. When inflation has skyrocketed, it might be restricting for those who have middle-income to access air transportation system when trying to visit long distance regions for prohibitively expensive tickets. In this way countries will destroy one of their principle sources of budgets.

The obvious conclusion to be drown is that there has been an enormous increase in the amount of air traffic around the world as a result in various problems. However, it is considered by some that taxes should be increased. I am totally opposed to this view. According to a recent survey conducted there has been a substantial increase in the amount of air traffic all around the world repercussion in distinct obstacles, furthermore a leading cause of this has been the growth of low-cost airlines. Although some people think that the key to solving these issues should be higher taxes for air travel. In my opinion, I completely disagree that it is the best way to tackle these stuffs.

Firstly, dealing with the issues surrounding pollution, noise and construction is not best solved by raising taxes. It will directly affect lower-class people. They will not travel as much as they did before due to inability to afford tickets an example to illustrate this point is some of them will be broken their promise to take their children to popular ski resort because of the sharp rise of taxes. Additionally, the inequalities between humans will be raised consequently it may make them feel humiliated and discontented with the aviation industry.

Secondly, from both an economic and cultural perspectives, tourism is the best source of revenue for host country. When inflation has skyrocketed, it might be restricting for those who have middle-income to access air transportation system when trying to visit long distance regions for prohibitively expensive tickets. In this way countries will destroy one of their principle sources of budgets.

Should the international community do more to tackle the threat of global warming? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Global warming is one of the major concerns that has proliferated during the past two decades. It is recommended to the worldwide societies to step forward and to roll up their sleeves to surmount the issue of global warming. Although this problem can better be surmounted by worldwide societies, yet national level contribution is essential as well.

To initiate with, international level efforts must be taken to plummet the impact of global warming because it is a hurdle for the whole earth as it affect the environment including flora and fauna, also with human beings. That is to say, due to the draconian activities of mankind namely deforestation, emission of fossil fuels from industries and vehicles, temperature of earth is accelerated. Hence, mother earth has suffered a lot. Thus, it is the responsibility of all the nations to step forward to lessen the effects of this phenomenon.

Conversely, nationwide initiatives would also be helpful for the betterment of this scenario. Since every nation has its own environment, weather, economic conditions and natural resources. Ergo, different countries have different needs and to fulfill those exigencies, realms need to perform distinct activities. To be more Specific, first world countries are the developed ones and are more industrialized. Hence, these countries make more pollution that leads to global warming. However, third-world nations have weak economy, thus those countries hardly earn living.

To recapitulate, global warming has deleterious impact on every single organism on earth. No doubt, it would be beneficial to overcome this threat at a global level, yet national level measures should also be found. ",No,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5
Solving environmental problems should be the responsibility of international organisations rather than each national government . Agree or disagree?,"Some argue that global organisations and corporations are responsible for environment-solving problems, instead of the government of each country. From my perspective, I totally disagree this statement.

On the one hand, it is true that having international organisations specializing in handling the environmental issues is beneficial to some countries. Because there are some developing nations don’t have abilities and sources to address this problem. Furthermore, some countries have to face a host of other issues such as starvation, flu pandemic, flooding, . . . . so they can’t clear up every matter. These are reasons why some nations really need international support, especially from developed countries, they can join hand and handle all issues together.

On the other hand, I believe that with only help from transnational organisations can’t address environmental problems properly, we also need the effort of the national government. Firly, although the environmental issues in different countries can share a lot similarities, but actually each nations’ problems drive from unsimilar causes and they need different approaches and solutions. For example, the USA is facing desertification caused by deforestation and over-exploitation, while that in China and Beijing is the result of accelerated urbanization. So the USA will have to cope with this problem with a solution which is different with that of China and Beijing.

In conclusion, despite the advantages of having international organisations in dealing with problems related to the environment, I think the government’s role still the best. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6.5
Current scenario of global warming and environmental change indicates that the world is in a perilous situation.,"Current scenario of global warming and environmental change indicates that the world is in a perilous situation. It is not serendipitous and has been the consequence of human deeds over the years. In the quest for industrial revolution and urbanization we failed to acknowledge the importance of environment in our day to day life. The outcome of this negligence is the increase in earth’s temperature and rise in sea level, increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and depleting ozone layer which has a larger impact in the ecosystem and ecology. Our future looks daunting if these issues are not addressed and resolved.

Recently various organizations, government bodies and individuals are constantly striving to resolve environmental issues in a hope to provide a better future for our next generation. These issues are accounted in national level as well as in global scale by various organization such as the United Nations. I believe in the quote that we should be the change we want to see in the world. Therefore, firstly before addressing global issue I feel it would be better if each nation tries to address the prevailing environmental concerns in their own country. Due to the larger geographical diversity amongst various countries the environmental issues might not be similar throughout the world albeit, the overall focus lies on saving our mother earth.

We cannot hope for others to come and solve our problems without taking any initiative ourselves. Therefore, the head of the nation and the government should primarily focus on the problems prevailing inside the country. For an example, in Nepal one of the major concern is the unmanaged and unplanned urbanization in many cities that has led to destruction of trees and disturbance of natural habitants in the surrounding areas. In contrary, in South Korea unplanned and unmanaged urbanization might not be a big issue. However, growing industrialization and the management of industrial waste might be a matter of concern.

Henceforth, after national issue has been addressed by individual nations it is always a good idea for the head of the nations or other concerned individuals to come together for discussion and delegation on the global environmental issue. Various international organizations are actively involved in resolving these issues related to environment and climate change. Furthermore, it is a topic of importance in various summits with the head of the nations such as the G20 summit, SAARC summit and in the European Union. When these issues are discussed globally, instead of the single perspective of a country, various aspects which was unnoticed earlier are discussed and a new vision may be developed. Moreover, preparation of various action plans would make it more systemized and organized for proper implementation and follow up.

Strategizing in any level either national or global regarding environmental issues is consequential at this time because the impact of environmental change is alarming. If proper action plan is not developed and implemented soon we might slowly be in the verge of extinction. Therefore, it is advisable that all the concerned bodies have their focus on this issue and work in collaboration to subsidize the risk associated at the earliest possible. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6
Some people say that the main environmental problem of our time is the loss of particular species of plants and animals. Others say that there are more important environmental problems. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"People seem to be divided over the issue of whether a today’s primarily environmental problem is a myriad of endangered creatures’ dying out at a shocking rate or not. Others, however, adopt a clear stance in favor of other significant environmental conundrums. The former idea, admittedly, seems to be more logical.

Considering the fact that a number of imperiled flora and fauna are soaring at an alarming rate, the proponents seem to give priority to such a pressing problem. This issue can bring about loss of biodiversity, interfering with the ecological equilibrium of the biosphere. Not only can such disruption take its toll on the food chain but also this can represent a real threat to humanity, ranging from their being deprived of sufficient food resources to their inability to attain medical achievements. Such irreversible loss would act as a stumbling block to the ideal standard of humans’ lives, casting a blight on their well-being.

Held against the aforementioned mindset is to attach more significance to other environmental difficulties a concrete example of which constitutes climate change. This perception is highly advocated by the opponents. It is believed that by taking climatic changes into consideration a myriad of obstacles with which people are grappling such as draught, extreme weather and floods can be to a large extent addressed. Contrary to the common belief, this is not to say that such deviation from expected climatic patterns will not have catastrophic consequences on wildlife and inhabitants, but this challenge, conceivably, seems to be trivial by comparison to the growing extinction of endemic species of sentient beings in addition to irreplaceable flora. Such depletion would presumably pose floods and other problems, stemming from loss of biodiversity. Only when climate change can be eradicated, is the decimation of animate beings averted.

To encapsulate, considering both sides of the argument, other environmental challenges such as climate change, presumably, seem to pale by comparison to the growing problem of a remarkable number of species’ being in jeopardy, inasmuch as such loss would per se bring about extreme weather and other irrefutable environmental issues.",No,No,No,No,No,No,5.5
"Nowadays, there is a growing trend of private car ownership. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages or environmental problems associated with this?","In the name of God

Todays, the number of personal car owners is rising. However, there are few advantage I believe there are more drawbacks. The essay firstly discusses that growing number of private cars leads to heavy long jams, air and sounds pollution that these negative consequences make government to adopt politics to reduce people desire for private car, followed by an analysis of how the primary advantage, namely more convenience and faster speed that an efficient public transport provide them as well.

The main disadvantage of increasing number of private cars is making traffic and pollution. Most of the car owners use their use their cars for commuting to work place at the specific time that leads to heavy traffics and making lots of pollution in the city. Also traffic leads to growing the fuel’s consuming and wearing of cars. Thus todays all over the world people face with the w biggest problems, lack of non-renewable resources and increasing the temperature of earth as a result all countries assigned an international covenant in 2000, that must all of them to reduce their produced pollution. Thus government imposed heavy taxes on private cars and fuel. In addition, they try to develop public transport and replace them with private car in order to keep earth safe and clean for next generation.

Those opposed to this say private car provide more convenience, moreover by developing technology and investing new green car the amount of produced pollution falls. However new cars are expensive and they don’t become common in the society also new system transport are replacing and developing in all over the world that make commuting easier and even faster than car. For example: Tesla company recently tested a new transport system that works based on creating a vacuum and its speed was about 300 km/h.

On the balance the fact that negative results of increasing number if private car outweigh flawed argument that provides faster and more convenient travel.",No,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5
"Cutting down forests is a real environmental threat; yet, this is still happening at a great rate around the world. Why do you think forests are being destroyed? Are there any benefits from the destruction of forests?","Deforestation is a major problem that put on danger our environment. This is not only national issue, but an international one. As far as I am concerned, ther is no pros of this massacre. We must protect our environment by forbidden such behaviours so we can keep ourselfs from harm. First of all, forest is the safe home for a range of animals. Then, cutting down the trees leave this creatures without a place to live. As a result, they will be a multiples deaths. In other words, the animals will be extincted. Nowdays, in Australy for example, the deforestation and fire issues result an extinction of the Lama. undoubtedly, this is a realy big warning alarm. On the other hand, seeing the forest desapear, disrupts the ecological balance, due to the fact that the big cause of the Global Warming is cutting down forests. according to recent research, the increase of forest fires and flooding is resulting from this phenomen. To conclue, the safety of our world is bound to the conserve of our environment. To sum up with, we are not living alone in this gloge, we share it with other creatures such as animals and plants. Thus we have to keep this balance if we want to live safely and healthy. Protecting our forests save animals lives and decrease the intensity of the Global Warming. ",No,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5
How the pollution can be solved ?,"Pollution is a major impact all over the world. In recent times each country faced problem related to pollution and damaged to the environment. There are several causes which are responsible for the pollution so we can solve this issue by using different methods.

Firstly, the air pollution is increasing day by day and the major reason for this is vehicle. For travelling people are using different vehicles which are produce the carbon monoxide in the environment and causing pollution. Another main pollution is water pollution. People throwing different plastic and industrialized water into river and sea which creates water pollution.

However every problem has a solution. So firstly air pollution can be solved by using government transportation. Government should promote people to use more uses of government buses rather than private vehicle. Another problem of air pollution can be solved by making some strict rules against people who through plastic or garbage into rives.

In conclusion, these are the major problem of air and water pollution which can be solved by using different transportation and making some rules. ",No,No,Yes,No,No,No,5
Traffic and pollution from vehicles,"Traffic and pollution from vehicles have become huge problems, especially in urban areas. This problem can be solved by increasing the price of petrol, but in long term, high fuel costs are unlikely to limit the number of drivers. Furthermore, increasing the price of petrol will also affect public transport costs. To solve this problem, it is necessary to develop technologies that use clean fuels such as producing electric cars that help run both quieter and cleaner. The application of this new technology will help improve air quality. However, this technology also cannot solve traffic jams. Therefore, to reduce pollution and traffic in the long term, it is necessary to strengthen the development of public transport services. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,5
What measures can be taken to deal with animal extinction?,"Extinction of Animals

The world is facing the problem of animal extinction because careless people do not attach importance to animal extinctions. However, we should protect animals for the reason that animals are creatures that cannot talk and cannot explain their problems. If we do not want to the point of animal extinction, the government should regulate laws about hunting, and associations should give seminars about deforestation.

The first solution is that the government should implement laws about hunting. There are a lot of hunters who do not care about hunting laws, and they continue to hunt animals. Amount of the fines are not a hindrance for hunting. To give an example, foregin hunters are coming to our country to hunt several vital animals because our fine is not too much for them. Consequently, the government ought to regulate fine’s amounts.

The second solution is that associations should give seminars about deforestation. Some people are unaware that the extinction of some animals is due to deforestation. Associations, such as THKD and Animal Rescue Association, should give seminars to schools and public places. There are a lot of reasons for deforestation, and one of them are unconscious forest fires. For instance, a number of people are going to the forest for a picnic. They do not care so much about their fire and they leave, leaving fire behind. A small fire grows and eventually leads to a large wildfire and extinction of animals. Consequently, associations should inform them with these examples.

In conclusion, from my point of view, animal extinction is a significant problem and it has two measures to deal with this problem which are the government should change the laws, and associations should announce to people the risk of deforestation. Every living thing in nature has the right to live, and no one should interfere with the right to life of any living thing.",No,No,Yes,No,No,No,6
Personal statement on my path to environmental service.,"I don’t just hike the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains in New Jersey for fun; I’m generally wielding a pair of garden shears and a folding saw. Last year, I started volunteering as a trail maintainer for the New York-New Jersey Trail Conference after noticing the increasing wear and tear of the trails, due to the park’s surging popularity since the start of the pandemic. Yet it’s not just the new hikers that are wearing the paths down, as overgrowth and erosion have been more prevalent following increasingly severe storms and precipitation. I love working to maintain and build these trails, as I improve the long-term sustainability of the mountain and its trails, no matter what effect either people or nature inflict.

In fact, I have always been very aware of the environment around me. Growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area amid consistent drought, fire, and smoke, it was hard not to notice. From a young age, I learned the benefits of California water conservation techniques such as “power showers” of less than five minutes and rules for toilet flushing (that often seemed to break learned etiquette). My family followed “Spare the Air” days by not lighting fires through much of the winter to avoid contributing to poor air quality with added particulate matter. In short, I grew up acutely aware of the power that community coordination and a shared vision could make to address large problems, such as climate change.

Recognizing that only collective problem-solving can drive change, I started my career making a small difference through engineering. I’m now ready to fully commit myself to championing sustainable practices for reduced carbon emissions.

Fortunately, I have actually been able to drive positive environmental impact as a natural gas pipeline engineer. The gas pipeline systems I have worked on constantly emit methane to the atmosphere through leaks in aging cast iron pipelines that need replacement. At DTE, I first learned to design pipeline projects to effectively replace these cast iron pipes with plastic ones that would not leak. I also took any spare time that I had to work with the engineer that calculated replacement order based on risk to better understand the approach to minimizing pipeline failures. This was my first exposure to the concurrent benefit of solutions that not only reduced emissions but also decreased operational costs from less leak management. With a better understanding of the natural gas industry, I took my next step to increase my impact through engineering with a move to PSEG in New Jersey.

After seeing the emission reduction potential in the natural gas industry, I joined PSEG to increase my impact. PSEG has the most miles of cast iron pipeline in the U. S. , leaving massive opportunity to design efficient solutions to reduce leaks and emissions through replacement. While I started working on the project design team, I soon moved to the group that determined replacement prioritization, where I ran the analyses that determine pipeline risk. In this position, I applied my past knowledge from DTE with the existing analysis methods at PSEG to identify locations that presented the highest risk of failure. Successful selection of high risk areas most effectively prevents future leaks by installing new plastic pipes before the aging pipes can fail. Further, I worked with subject matter experts at PSEG to implement a new probabilistic model for risk ranking to more accurately determine risk ranking for all pipes in the system. Each day at work, I enhance the operation of existing pipelines with clear impact on emissions and the environment.

While I have been able to make small, incremental improvements to pipeline operation, the underlying system will continue to slowly emit carbon dioxide emissions until a larger, systemic change is made. I want to work on changes to the energy system that do not simply adjust existing systems, but instead re-imagine entire processes to remove the source of carbon emissions altogether. While my past experience provides a baseline for change, I have much to learn before I can advance the wave of ESG investing and planning and lead a company that provides net-zero solutions necessary to address the climate crisis.

My technical background can only get me so far in leading the path towards promoting global sustainability. I need to understand the business case and financial drivers that businesses face when making decisions that impact their carbon footprint. I need to learn more about energy markets and policy to be able to effectively adjust and improve the existing systems. To drive change on the magnitude that is necessary to limit global warming, multiple companies across all industries need to take action with their environmental impact in mind, advancing sustainable technology and reinventing their business.

At HBS, I would learn everything necessary to drive such change. HBS provides both the curriculum and the faculty expertise to teach any management and sustainability fundamentals that I need to succeed in my future career. HBS presents a welcome challenge that would perfectly place me in position to lead in a business future that will have no choice but to prioritize the environment. ",No,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5
"What types of pollution does your neighborhood faces. What are the causes, effects and solutions for the types of pollution?","In recent years, my neighborhood has had to handle several intricate issues about air pollution. To everyone's knowledge, air pollution occurs when the atmosphere contains gases, dust, or fumes in harmful amounts, hence a load of factors contributing to causing air pollution. We can divide them into two types: the primary source pollutants and other minor ones. Perhaps the main point is that residents appear to be deficient in common sense about our atmospheric environment. Regardless of some modern equipment assisting humans in heating, some households are not affluent enough to purchase overpriced products; thus, they are reluctant to burn out fossil fuels to heat food, drinks. This approach, however, may create a great amount of CO2 in the environment-which affects the atmosphere seriously. In addition, dirty sewage, pesticides, and herbicides used in the fields can damage the environment. These factors have astonishing effects on the air. The quality of the atmosphere can decrease drastically, while people are easily infected with lung cancer, heart disease if they inhale too many poisonous gases. It causes severe damage to other living organisms such as animals, food crops, and artificial buildings.

We begin with transport. Emissions from cars greatly damage the environment and the fact that almost every citizen has one doesn’t make it any better. A good solution to that would be to motivate people to use electric cars. The second place to check would be rivers and seas. Anything from sunken transport to waste thrown out by people should be cleaned since it creates trouble both for animals and us. The third problem would be littering. Why? Because a lot of packaging used and thrown away is not biodegradable. Keeping the package on your person and throwing it away at the bin should do the trick.

In conclusion, I have shown you that we have a lot of problems with taking care of environment, but we have the solutions to them. All we need is just enough time and effort.

Throughout our lives we learn many things and obtain many characteristics. Some are good, some are bad. It’s really hard to say which one is the most useful. But I would say that the most useful thing I have ever learned is the ability to look at life a little more easier and find balance in things you do on every day basis.

You can’t expect great work if you don’t have a great rest. These things are pretty proportional, in my opinion. Not only that, living in constant stress and work won’t do you a lot of good, so a rest that can take care of all that before the next time you sit to do something tedious should be helpful. But don’t let that rest take all of your time or else you’ll fall behind. Plan your time ahead, balance your rest and work so that you won’t be consumed by them. Doesn’t that sound great?

In the end, not everyone will agree with me, but that’s ok. That’s my opinion and I agree with myself. I just wanted to share that thought with anyone reading this.",No,No,No,No,No,No,5.5

It remains one of the most important problems for the whole world because environmental conditions influence on our lifestyle.

In my opinion, these problems can be solved! I do believe that everything depends only on the human conscience, that can persuade people to change.

For example, we can refuse from using personal transport. It can lead to reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Also we can reduce pouring harmful substances into lakes and oceans by building recycling plants.

Moreover, we can sponsor the scientific programs that can help humanity to invent new sources of green energy that will save the Earth.

However, a lot of people think that it is impossible to save the nature because of the progress that they can not stop. They say that we can not replace internal combustion engines, use other energy sources because we are used to using them killing nature.

In conclude, I realize that people can create everything that they want. So, if they want to save the nature, they will find the way to do it.

The most useful skill

Have you ever learnt something that changed your life? I think that it is hard to imagine the knowledge that can do it! However, I have already got such experience.

The most important thing that I learnt in my life was an ability to repair cars and build them. When I was a child I always liked to play with LEGO. My father, who studied to be mechanic, saw it and started to teach me how the cars work. You would probably think that it was boring for me. However, it wasn’t! I was so excited that I even refused from LEGO and started to spend all days with my father in our garage.

Now I work as a car mechanic at Toyota company and help to create new engines. It is so cool to be a part of such big organization and help people to invent new car technologies. I love it!

The most pressing ones deal with the influence of different kinds of cars on the environment, rivers and seas contamination, and greenhouse gas emissions of factories.

Firstly, the result of a transport’s work affects the ecology in a bad way. The pollution of the environment by exhaust fumes is the biggest problem in the world. In my humble opinion, this issue can be solved by limiting the increasing number of drivers.

Secondly, rivers and seas pollution is very pressing, too. There are many sources of their contamination, for instance, oil transporting and accumulations of rubbish. I think that this problem will be partly solved if people pick up trash ashore.

Finally, greenhouse gas emissions of factories are very dangerous for the environment, too. The reason for it is that these emissions may cause global warming. I suppose this issue can’t be solved because it will be necessary to remove all factories. It is unreal and unbeneficial.

To summarize, even the most dangerous environmental problems can be solved, but their solution may take a long time.

Global warming is one tof,"Nowadays, our living conditions have become quite sophisticated than before due to global warming. The temperature of the Earth has been rising yearly and also leading to climate change and numerous disasters over the world. In this essay, I will present some of the causes of this issue and also give some solutions to deal with.

It can be seen that plants have a prominent role in controlling the atmosphere. It absorbs carbon dioxide and then emits oxygen into the environment. However, many natural resources especially the rain forests (known as the lunge of the Earth) have been demolished to provide the population growth. Another reason for global warming is that the emissions from using fossil fuels as well as industries, which caused the greenhouse effects. Many companies in developing countries recently have no processing system for fumes during working. Moreover, our lives have been depending on electricity. The amount of electricity consumed every day seems to be uncountable. This consumption also leads to creating large heat in the environment.

There are several solutions to facing worldwide problems. Firstly, we should refer to using more and more renewable energy such as solar or wind power, etc. These are eco-friend resources to our habitats. Secondly, the government should give plenty of policies which encourage residents not only to plant more trees but also diminish the cutting plant’s problems. Lastly, the modification in the use of transport also has many beneficial effects. People should tend to use eco-vehicle such as electronic bikes, electronic cars, etc. By the way, our life should approach to more public transport than using our vehicles.

To conclude, human activity is a substantial influence on global warming to our environment. Countries should have serious rules and policies to protect our natural life. Everyone must raise awareness of this catastrophe. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,5.5
Nowadays tourism often leads to environmental destruction. Why is this the case? What are the consequences? How to solve this problem?,"It is a sad reality that although tourism is a great recreational activity, it is also destructing our environment in many ways. It has a various negative impacts on the life of both animals and humans but by implementing strict laws this problems can be easily tackled to a great extent.

There is one main reason by the environment is degrading. Firstly, these days, tourist destinations are trying their best to attract as many people as they can in order to attempt them to come in their city. Because most of the states or countries are dependent up on tourists. As a result of which a lot of people went to enjoy in these places. Further, the natural resources of that particular place are consumed or used in a great quantity in order to meet up the demands of the visitors. Which finally results in the depletion of the natural resources. Thus, it causes the destruction of the environment.

Moving further, if more tourists will be allowed continually to visit like they are going on to tourist destination, it can really have a negative consequence up on people and on all the living things of that place. For instance, if the water level of that tourist place went down then everyone in that area have to suffer. Because it is sure that more people will result in the consumption and the usage of more water.

However, there are also some steps that can be taken to address this situation. To begin with, every tourist destinations should set some limitation up on how many travelers can visit their place at once and with these there will not be too much crowd at that place. Other thing that can be done is that, there should also be limitations up on days that how many days one traveler can stay at their place. Following these two steps, the environment will become much better.

In conclusion, although too much visitors are causing an environment issues and is putting a negative effects upon people and animals, this problem can be rooted out by putting some limitations on the number of tourists and on the days that visitors should stay in that place.

Humans are damaging the environment. What humans’ activities cause environmental damage? What can the government and individual people do to address these problems?,"In the modern world, residents are destroying the ecosystem in many activities. While there are many factors leading to natural degradation, the authorities and human beings can take some actions to handle them.

The problem of natural resources could be attributed to some reasons. First of all, factories discharge sewage into the water bodies. In fact, although these substances are extremely toxic, many manufacturers do not use waste treatment systems. For example, chemicals from that killed aquatic creatures and posed a threat to citizens' health. Moreover, residents have a low awareness of protecting surroundings. In spite of the fact that the state has set regulations for waste disposal. For instance, people dump domestic wastes on the street. In transportation, more people commute by motorbike and car than public transport, while exhaust fumes from private vehicles cause air pollution.

There are some measures that the government and residents should take to alleviate the environmental damage. First, the government should force factories to install waste management systems. Companies that cause air pollution and water contamination or abandon the regulations need to be severely punished. As these policies are stringent, they can ensure industrial development and environmental sustainability. Furthermore, individuals should increase their knowledge about the ways of dealing with nature and take public transportation and have a habit of walking, which is eco-friendly.

In conclusion, although the environmental issues have been caused by citizen’s production and daily lives, the government and dwellers can adopt some measures to tackle them. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6.5

Why do people go shop online?What are the environmental problems cause by this trend,"It is certainly true that online shopping is increasing in popularity in recent years. In this essay, I will illustrate the reason for this outbreak and the adverse impact on the environment caused by this issue.

The obvious reason that people prefer to shop online is that the Internet provides a huge variety of choices for consumers to choose. When people are surfing the Internet, they can find out that there are various items that they can buy with, for instance shoes, clothes and households, which is convenient for them. Some of them even offer more discounts than buying from the reality shops which helps to save money with a loyalty card. Furthermore, people are also allowed to compare prices between different shops just by clicking a button. As people now live in a fast paced environment, they have to race against the clock for studies and work. Having this function can help customers to save time from shopping around.

However, having too much virtual shopping will cause various negative effects on our environment. Firstly, they will cause a myriad of pollutants. As I mentioned, the prices of the products are extremely cheaper than in the reality shops, people will folk into the website and buy it, despite the product's usefulness. After they receive items, they will suddenly not be fond of them and as a result, they will become garbage. This will result in the landfill saturation, lots of pollution problems will occur, for example water pollution and air pollution.

In conclusion, although shopping online is very convenient, cheaper and saves time. However, it might cause a lot of environmental problems, water pollution and air pollution. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6
"This is a true story told by a British-South African environmental activist, Lewis Pugh.","Lewis Pugh is a British-South African environmentalist who works hard to protect the oceans of the world. One way he

does this is by swimming! He goes on difficult swims in different parts of the world. People from various countries read

about Lewis Pugh and watch him swim. Pugh swam at the North Pole to warn people that some of the Arctic Sea ice was

disappearing. Another time he swam in a lake on Mount Everest to warn the governments about the effect of climate change

in the Himalayas. This is what Lewis Pugh says:

‘Ocean water covers 70% of the earth. But human behaviour is having negative effects on the oceans. Ocean water is

becoming dirty and polluted. Many kinds of fish and sea animals are dying off. The Ross Sea in Antarctica is different, it’s

completely free of pollution. It contains many different animals and fish such as the Antarctic Toothfish, the Colossal

Squid* and the Emperor Penguin. Many of these animals and fish cannot be found anywhere else on the planet. I want to

gain global support for the Ross Sea so that it becomes a Protected Area. Because of that I decided to go on five symbolic

swims in Antarctica. My first Antarctic swim was near Campbell Island in New Zealand. I started to swim in the freezing

water. But after 200 metres, a sea lion attacked me. ",No,No,No,No,No,No,5.5
"In in contemporary world, people are more concerned about global warming due to this considerabe calamitous impacts.","In in contemporary world, people are more concerned about global warming due to this considerabe calamitous impacts. At the result, partly of communities assert that to mitigate the potential damages, the policy- makers should increase the petroleum prices for declining the demand and excessive consumption from the citizens. Personally, I indubitably disagree and i will have a disputable discussion related this argument in the essay below.

Recently, one of the most serious issues, which posing a threat to our planet is global warming. It has been scientifically proven that the earth average temperatures on the surface has increased a couple of degree in the last century, causing by the increasing greenhouse gas emissions, which directly enhance the concentration of carbon dioxides and leading the depletion of our atmosphere.

Hence, legislators considered to increase the fossil fuel prices to reduce the demands of people. However, this not perceived a feasible solution due to the fact that the pollution sources not only comes from the transportations but also consituted by manufacturing and entended for other application. To be specific, unsustainable development and rapidly expanding industrial also contributing to the devastating of natural habitats. Consequences, by increasing petroleum cost the commodity prices would increase instantaneously, therefore directly induce adversely impacts on people’s lives, especially those living in poverty are more likely suffer from this phenomenon.

On the other hand, intensive implementation more revitalization programs and city’s garbage segregation considered ideally solutions to ameliorate to deleterious impacts of global warming. Simultaneously, legislators should allocate more education propagation campaigns for arousing people awareness realated evironmental issues. Lastly, by approaching these possible solutions, the adversely impacts of pollutions and destabilization could be mitigated.

Taking all into consideration, whether government should rise the fossil fuel cost or not is still a controversial issue. personally, I hold firm discourage this assertion for various negative consequences. ",Yes,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5
Global warming cause and sollution,"In today's world global warming is one of the most hazardous issues.

What should we do to deal with this problem?

This essay will explore a number of reasons for this and give a couple of sollutions.

Firstly, one of the manin causes of global warming is erosion of the ozone layer.

At the current time there are numerous factories, vehicles, aircrafts an so on.

All of them are emitting smogs, fumes and greenhouse gasses. They cause of both AIR Pollution and damage to the ozone layer.

In oreder to prevent this matter,

manufacturers ought to stop using gas, instead they should utilyze solar, wind and water power.

Moreover, deforestation should be banned and a lot of trees should be planted.

In light of the fact that, trees absorb harmful gases and emit oxygen. Then it maight aid the ozone layer to revive.

there is another reason for this global problem as well.

It is undoubtedly wastes in the landfill sides. These non biodegradable wastes usually emit greenhouse gases.

the longer wastes maintain the more  poisonous they will be.

Sometimes people  burn wastes to dispose of them, it is so dangerous damage to the environment and could be reason for global warming

In conclusion, Global warming can be stopped by a joint effort by the individuals and the government. Deforestation must be banned and trees should be planted more. The use of automobiles must be limited and manufacturer must use environmentally friendly methods.",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,5
"Deforestation is one of the many issues that plague the world's environment today as vanishing forests are readily observed in the 21th century. In your opinion, what factors might explain this phenomenon? Discuss your ideas, with examples.","Deforestation is a phenomenon that impact seriously on the world’s environment today. It is easy to see that more and more forests begin to disappear in the 21th century. From my perspective, there are some factors can cause this phenomenon.

One factor for causes of deforestation is that human cut down forests excessively. Such deforestation has long been driven by farmers desperate to earn a living or by loggers building new roads into pristine forest. But now new data appears to show that big, block clearings that reflect industrial deforestation have come to dominate, rather than these smaller-scale efforts that leave behind long, narrow swaths of cleared land. With the increasing urbanization of the developing world, there is a lack of land for people so that they cut down forests to make houses and road. In addition, wood is one of the popular materials for industrial products such as making paper, tables, chairs. . . Because of human’s requirements, forests will soon become extinct.

Another cause of deforestation is climate change. Lately due to global warming and others factors rain fall less respect the past years. This can dry out the forest causing fire that burn hectares and fire is another problem that doesn’t help prevent the deforestation. Some reports indicate that a changing climate could also be contributing to the ferocity of the fires. 23% of tree cover losses result from wildfires and climate change increase their frequency and power. Global warming is a factor that make the temperature increases than the average temperature which affects the plants growth or soil growth. Therefore, forests are becoming narrow because of climate change.

In conclusion, human and climate change are factors that cause deforestation. To reduce this phenomenon, the government should curb the felling of trees by enforcing a series of rules and laws to govern it and factories should release less emission. ",No,No,Yes,No,No,No,5
The effect of noise pollution,"Noise pollution is a problem affecting millions of people in modern society. In places where there is a lot of noise, its negative consequences can be seen in Auditory effects, material destruction and mental disorders.

The first effect of noise pollution is Auditory declines. Because living for a long time in an environment with loud sounds, deafness or hearing loss is obvious. It can occur with continuous exposure to noise levels of more than 90 dB, so this condition can be temporary or permanent. In addition, Explosions or other high-pitched sounds can cause immediate deafness by perforating the victim's eardrum. For example, using a loudspeaker to shout loudly into someone's ear can cause their ears to bleed and be unable to hear anything.

As a result, the increase in noise pollution also causes emotional and psychological disorders. Noise can affect rest and disrupt people's daily activities, adversely affect their mental health such as irritability or loss of temper; therefore, people will find it harder to focus on work and study when there is too much noise. For instance, When children live near factories or highways, they are easily distracted and inefficient in learning, especially for children who are just starting to learn letters.

Another result of noise pollution is serious damage to facilities. Because vibrations caused by certain sound waves can cause structural damage to buildings. Moreover, the explosion of noise affected in cracks in the walls of buildings. One striking is the explosive sound of an airplane taking off can shatter windows and buildings

In conclusion, this analysis may help explain the negative effects of noise pollution on hearing loss, material damage and mental disorders. Obviously we need more solutions to limit noise and promote a more peaceful life. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6.5
"Light pollution (excessive light during night time) is a form of pollution that distresses many people, especially in modern cities. What are the causes of light pollution, and what solutions can you suggest for governments and businesses to take?","These days living in cities has increased. Light pollution is becoming an increasingly important issue in big cities. There seem to be two main causes, and also two solutions which will be explained in this essay.

the main cause is the use of lighting for advertising in public spaces. For example, nowadays, big cities are fitted with some forms of light for advertising. These advertisements use flashing lights and videos and sometimes pictures that have light pollution. A second cause is a large number of street lamps and security lights in cities, which are intended to reduce accidents and crime by removing darkness at night.

Turning to possible solutions, it might be tempting for the government to reduce the number of electric advertising in the streets, but in many cases, these signs are an important way to advertise. It would be difficult to reduce these advertisements and also reduction of street lamps may be caused to increase in accidents and crimes so, these are needed to keep residents and travelers safe. Therefore, using low consume lamps is a better solution. In addition, Learning citizens to reduce their consumption of electricity is another solution for this issue. Learning individuals to change their behaviors and pattern of consumption of electricity can help to decline light pollution. For example, people should know about the hours that the consumption of electricity is high so, they have to use few electrical machines.

Overall, advertising and public lighting are the main factors for this problem. The solutions for this issue are the using low consume eclectic lamps, and learning residents to reduce their electricity use, which helps the citizens to live in a space without light pollution. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,5.5
The Best Way to Solve the World’s Environmental Problems Is to Increase the Cost of Fuel,"It has been recommended that out of many solutions, the best solution is to hike the prices of petrol and diesel to ameliorate environmental hazards. I thoroughly agree with the statement because fewer vehicles will run on the road and demand for other means of transport will rise such as cycles or e-rickshaws.

First off, escalating the prices of fuel will make the masses use their types of machinery less. Resultantly, there will be less pollution. To elaborate it, the paradigm shift makes people use their individual vehicles, and the emission of toxic gases from these vehicles deteriorate the air quality, and the environment gets polluted. This contaminated ambience is not suitable for dwellers of any city or town. Therefore, if the prices increase, people will not run their vehicles. They will not enhance their financial burden, such as the money they have saved for eating outside, paying for gym facilities, and throwing parties. They will need to cut their expenses to refuel their cars or any vehicle. So, it is good to raise the prices of conventional fuel.",No,No,Yes,No,No,No,5
In some countries fast food restaurants and supermarkets give money to schools to promote their product. Do you think it’s a positive or negative development?,"In a number of countries, supermarket and junk food resorts want to do advertisement of their cusinies with the help of educational institudes through paid promotion. A number of masses believe that it is a positive enlargement. However, in this essay, I will discuss the reasons why I believe that it is the negative evolution.

There are several reasons to support my view. The effective one is that they will promote unhealthy food. In other words, nowadays people are suffering from many disease because of the excessive take of junk food. Therefore, if they will promote it in schools. Schoolers will buy more fast food. In future, which will lead to many diseases and unhealthy lifestyle. For example, various institutes in guide can lie to child er about products and manipulate them. So that they can purchase it. In result, they will get crampt by the words.

On the other side, there are a number of citizen who reckon that it is a positive development. For them, the main reason is that. If they give honest promotion of products. Children will get aware about the harmful effects of junk food as well. Moreover, they will get to know the reality. For example, there are numerous schoolers who follow their role model and celebrities in every way but they do not aware about the real life of them. Consequently, honest review will open their eyes.

By the way of conclusion, I would say that although there is a positive effect of it in someway. Nevertheless, my belief is that it have more bad effects than good. Therefore, it is the negative development. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6
"In the most countries, fast food is becoming cheaper and more available. Do you think the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?","In my perspective, Ibelieve the tremendously downsides of junk food surpass its merits, and I will attempt to explain that in the paragraphs below. This trend brings about several evitable advantages for eating fast food, which are turned towards main meals by many people in other countries. In the first place, junk food is too easy to approach all walks of life. This is because, people can consume fast food while they still avoid of effect to their living expense. For example, it is clearly seen that Mac Donal in US or Canada is extremely cheap with 1. 99 dorlla on a humberger, which is enough for the amount of food in lunch or in dinner. Another merits worth mentioning is that taste of junk food is comformity with several people. As a result, instead of spending time for thinking what they can eat, people in many countries will choose fast food in the most of time. Despite the clear benefits, the development of junk food has several inevitable disadvantages. People will able to put themselves at high risk of health problems, as well as suffer the obesity in all of ages due to consumming of fast food too much and eating unhealthy food for a long period of time. For instance, fatty acids in this kind of food can block arteries and cause high blood pressure and even stroke. Take a documentary called “Super Size Me” as an example, a girl eating fast food continuously for 30 days faced the drastic effect on her well- being, and needed to spend 14 months to get back her previous health condition. In conclusion, the development of junk food provides people both possitive and nagetive impacts. However, I still believe that the downsides they can receive are far more superior than the benefits when the fast food is more available and more cheaper. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,5

In my opinion, despite various benefits that fast food has brought to us, its drawbacks should not be ignored.

The convenience and time saving capability of fast food are two main factors that help people to adjust with living in a hectic lifestyle.

Moreover, people can buy fast food anytime they want. With the development of the Internet, it is much easier to order food online, as a result, saving some money for moving. Another important reason is that, tax on fast food is not expensive so it creates the adequate conditions for people to purchase their desirable fast food which is suitable for their budget.

Secondly, fast food has a huge impact in the health sector. Most tangibly, this concerns to obesity. The best example of this is in the US, where obesity is reaching epidemic proportions.

Food contents that are high in fat, sugar, and over processed ingredients have been proven to heart disease which is the common cause of death around the world. However, this cannot be blamed entirely on fast food but there are very few healthy options on most fast food menus

"In this concurrent era, eating fast food is ubiquitous globally.","In this concurrent era, eating fast food is ubiquitous globally. It is therefore suggested that enforcing tax on junk food is not feasible solution to eat good food but I feel the other way as to arrange campaign about importance of healthier diet and reduce the price of good food.

Firstly, imposing tax on canned food which is not only solution to encourage the people but instead of enforcing tax, authorities should organize the program about value of nutrition for people's health due to that people can understand the importance of healthy diet, and they also vigilant to take unhealthy food in their routine. Additionally, government should telecast some advertisement about sever diseases which occur by having too much fast food as a result people would more attentive to have quick food. For instance, a recent survey by an international health organization depicts the 75% of people afflicting by fatal diseases like cholesterol problem, blood pressure, diabetes and many more.

Moreover, Government should diminish the rate of nutritional food due to that everyone can afford good food. Although many may argue that quick food is more tasty and easily available everywhere and any time, however, I feel, it may have less nutrition like protein, vitamin, amino acid and many more. Furthermore, if authorities put high rate of tax on junk food, it may trouble for working people or students those who have no time for preparing food at home because such people may not afford that much amount of money to purchase ready-made food.

In conclusion, arranging campaign and advertising are playing vital role for awareness about to take wholesome food. Therefore, I fully disagree that putting tax on processed food is not solution to inspire to take nourishing food. ",Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,7
The main causes of increasing body weight and decreasing fitness levels are the sedentary lifestyle of people and excessive consumption of junk food.,"The main causes of increasing body weight and decreasing fitness levels are the sedentary lifestyle of people and excessive consumption of junk food. Fast food companies are spending millions of dollars to promote their products on TV and the internet. These commercials make unhealthy food seem extremely tempting and mouth-watering. As a result, people especially children unconsciously gorge on them. Unfortunately, excessive consumption of junk leads to obesity and health problems because obese people are more likely to develop diabetes and heart trouble.

Another factor contributing to growing cases of obesity is the sedentary lifestyle of people. Due to the growing academic and work pressure, children as well as adults do not get enough time to work out. Worse, even when people are free, instead of working out in a gym, they prefer to watch a movie on the TV or computer. This way of life has a negative impact on their health.

Promoting health awareness among people and enforcing strict censorship on food advertisements are the best ways to combat this issue. The government and the media should inform people of the harmful consequences of leading an inactive life. Once the public are aware of the negative effect of obesity, they are more likely to take actions to change their lifestyle. Another solution is to ban misleading food advertisements that target children. The government must ensure that food companies are not promoting unhealthy food as healthy.

To conclude, there is no denying the fact that the growing cases of obesity and decreasing levels of health are a major concern around the world. To combat this issue, the government should launch health awareness campaigns and ban misleading ads that encourage the consumption of fast food.",No,No,Yes,No,No,No,5
"The fast food industry has negative effects on our health, the environment and family eating habits, Do you agree or disagree?","Well, fast food industry gaining ground in this days as it can change people licker into pink. some people argued that, heath of people and ways of eating are mostly affected by junk food stuffs that are produced by food industry. In my opinion, I barely agree with this opinion. On this essay I will give both view according with this statement.

There are manifold points to explain my point of view. First and foremost, quality of junk food affect on people health in a wrong way. For instance, fast food is not only unhygienic but also contained lack of nutrients, vitamins and minerals that lead an unhealthy environment. Thus, unhealthy diet can rise to enormous health issue as it has no purity.

further emphasizing my point of view. Fast food services which are always ready to serve reduce our manual work. however, it is vital to remain fit and healthy. As a result, lazy and fatigue become our companion due to curtailing in the amount of manual work. In addition, people get addicted to eat fast food more and more and are avoiding fresh homemade food. Consequently, value of homemade food is decreasing as it has common taste among people. on the contrary, others have conflicting views.

They think that, junk food offers enormous variety in food so that people can change their taste who are fed from daily boring food. Thence, mixture of spices and ingrediants work as a magnet to attract people at fast food point. What is more, junk food are very easy to make as it is time consuming. Finally, In the jet age of 21st century fast food points lucrative to save our precious time.

In Some Countries An Increasing Number Of People Are Suffering From Health Problems As A Result Of Eating Too Much Fast Food | Band 8 IELTS Essay Sample,"In certain countries people are facing too many health issues due to excessive consumption of fast food. Some people are of the view that to bring this in control the government ought to increase the tax on such food items. However, I completely disagree with this view as I feel that imparting health related knowledge to the citizens and banning hazardous food items are the best ways to deal with this problem.

Undoubtedly, consuming too much fast food leads to many health related concerns. To tackle this, the government has to step in and impart education to the citizens regarding the amount of fast food they can eat and its ill effects rather than imposing higher tax as it will increase the burden on middle class people. To illustrate, in most of the countries about 65% of the population consists of middle class and if the state imposes higher taxes on any food item they will be the most affected lot. Therefore educating people of all class about the health issues arising out of junk food consumption is more feasible.

Fast food contains certain ingredients which are extremely harmful to the human body. Such ingredients should be banned by the government to deal with the health problems arising out of its consumption. This step can eradicate the problem from its root cause. For example, Ajinomoto is one such ingredient which is extensively used in fast food preparations. Health specialists consider it as the slow poison to the human body and it also causes cancer. This kind of food substances used in fast food should be put on the banned list. This measure will be more successful than increasing the tax on fast food.

In conclusion, I firmly believe that imposing tax will not help much in solving the health issues arising out of excessive consumption of fast food as it will not address the root cause of the issue; rather it would put more economic pressure on poor and middle class sections of the society.

Effects of Fast Food on people,"Cause and effect essay.

*Effects of Fast Food*

These dsys we see lots of advertisements for fast food restaurants. But why do people try to promote unhealthy food and what are the reasons for these? Maybe because The fast food is easy to cook and prepared and it is easily available. The people who benefit of these businesses have their own purposes and it is financial improvements.

There are causes that may led to the growth of the fast-food industry. But what is more important is the effects that it has on society and peole including health problem, obesity and

loss of the family tradition of eating together.

One important effect of fast food is that it can get people's health in danger status. First, we must say that fast food can cause vitamin deficiencies that in turn, causes diseases.

Obesity is one of the results of fast food on the human body. Obesity comes because fast food enriches the body with fats. So people will become less healthy, less effective, and less productive, and this is the results of obesity.

Another serious effect of fstt food is the loss of the family tradition of eating together. The family used to eat together, and thus they had the opportunity to talk with each other for daily problems.

Fast food also has an effect on the income of the family. The conclusion is that fast food is more expensive than the food you cook for yourself.

To summarize, it can be said that fast food has been one of the disasters of today societies. Unfortunately, the effects containing

health problem, obesity and loss of the family tradition of eating together can be considered as disadvantages. It has unuseful effects on the human body and health are not positive. It also has other negative effects on the income of a family. It would be grear if people avoid eating unhealthy food.",No,No,No,No,No,No,5.5
"In many countries, traditional foods are being replaced by fast food. This has a negative impact on families, individuals and society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays, the pace at which people live is fast. Many people are pressed for time because they have hectic lifestyle. Therefore, many of them choose fast food over traditional home-made foods since the convenience foods are available in every restaurant and take less time for preparation as its name represents. Many commentators believe they have detrimental effects on people, their family and the community on the whole.

It is indisputable that despite home-made foods, which are rich in vitamins and useful minerals, fast food has poor nutritional value. It is high in fat, sugar, salt and artificial additives which contribute to many diseases for individuals like indigestion and obesity. Physical problems aside, unhealthy eating habits are one of major factors leading to mental health and depression.

Moreover, the prevalence of fast food restaurants has negatively affected families as well. Being inexpensive and taking less time for preparation as attractive attributions of fast food prompt many individuals to have their food outside home. This in turn, limits the opportunity for family members to sit together in meal time and share their experience. In the long run, family ties will be weakened as they spend less time together.

Communities also have been negatively affected as a result of people’s unhealthy lifestyles involved with indulging in fast food. The society whose people are suffering from physical and mental problems is less likely to be a prosperous community. This situation is compounded by the fact that many financial resources that could be employed in many fields like educational should be allocated to address this issue.

To conclude, it seems to me that consumption of fast food has led to unfavorable lifestyles which have adversely affected the communities and families. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6
In some countries people are increasingly suffering from health problems caused by fast food. Some people suggest governments should impose higher taxes on fast food. To what extent do you agree with this arguement?,"In some countries food related health problems are on the rise due to excessive consumption of fast food. Some people argue that, government should impose higher taxes on fast food. Personally, I totally agree with this arguement, and in this essay, I will outline two reasons why I favour higher taxes.

First and foremost, increasing taxes will increase food prices. As taxes are raised, fast food chains will be forced to increase the price of their products. As a consequence of price hike, individuals will less likely eat these kind of food items. For example, in Nepal, the government raised taxes on tobacco products by 50%. As a result, more than 60% of smokers tried to quit smoking. Hence, increase in price of anything demotivates the people to consume them. Secondly, the tax money can be spent on health care. As the tax increases, governments will have more funds to spend on civil well being. Since, food related health problems are on the rise, this extra tax money can be spent to improve health care system. For example, increased funding for health care will also improve the process of diagonosis and treatment, which will result in healthier population. In conclusion, imposing higher taxes can help increase funding for services that help to improve everyone's quality of life.

All in all, I strongly believe that increasing taxes on fast food will benefit everyone. Firstly increased prices will discourage people to continue eating unhealthy food. Secondly, increased tases can help to improve health care system by increasing funding. We will have a healthy life, if we become conscious about what we eat. ",No,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5
In some countries an increasing number of people are suffering from health problems as a result of eating too much fast food. It is therefore necessary for government to impose a higher tax on this kind of food. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"""Health is like a baby, give it time, be gentle, and feed the baby properly and you are good to go""Taking care of one's health should be the priority of every person. But the increasing number of sales in fast food shows that people are taking their health lightly. They are consuming food just to satisfy and not improve. The subsequent paragraph elaborates more on the view with an appropriate illustration. Nowadays, humans are suffering a lot of health issues. The fact they do not realize is that it is because of the consumption of unhealthy food. Fast food has made a very impact on human life and is now slowly killing the human race. While eating this kind of food people just concentrate on the taste but not on the content. Consuming junk food is fine but until a limit, exceeding the limit results in bad health. For instance, eating more fat content food can result in a major medical problem known as Obesity. Humans have a tendency to grab this kind of food because they might be late for work and do not get time to have a proper meal, or some people just like munching all the time which leads them to eat fast food. For example, I have a habit of munching all the time and this has lead to some major health problems like lack of vitamin D. To conclude, I strongly agree with the fact that eating too much fast food is resulting in many health problems in some countries. The government should impose a higher tax on fast food so before buying people would think twice and it is possible they will not buy instead eat something healthy. ",No,No,Yes,No,No,No,5
"With the advent of urbanisation and the rise in popularity of fast food, there have been accompanying issues with rising obesity rates – especially in developed countries like England and the USA.","With the advent of urbanisation and the rise in popularity of fast food, there have been

accompanying issues with rising obesity rates – especially in developed countries like

England and the USA. After providing a careful analysis of why obesity has risen so

sharply in these countries, I shall suggest a number of ways in which the obesity

epidemic can be ameliorated.

To begin with, it should be unsurprising that fast food is incredibly popular in wealthy

countries (like England and the USA). Due to the high levels of development in these

countries, consumers possess more money and can therefore consume vast amounts

of fast food without seriously diminishing their income. For example, the American

Dietary Association found that (compared to the average Indian household), the

average American household has a six times larger budget for food per month.

Consequently, it is to be expected that obesity rates are much higher in countries with

larger amounts of wealth.

However, despite the severity of the obesity problem, there are a number of ways in

which developed countries could battle it more effectively. Firstly, developed

governments could put far more pressure on fast food outlets to provide healthy

alternatives to hamburgers, french fries and soft drinks. Secondly, public exercise initiatives could be advertised and promoted far more vigorously. Lastly, modules that inform teenagers about healthy dietary requirements could be taught at schools.

"In today’s society, people are leaving traditional eating habits and enjoying fast food as main meals to accommodate with rising contemporary lifestyles.","In today’s society, people are leaving traditional eating habits and enjoying fast food as main meals to accommodate with rising contemporary lifestyles. While I accept that consuming these prepared foods can sometimes have a positive effect on the eaters, I believe that they are more likely to have a harmful impact.

On the one hand, having Fast food can be both time saving and entertaining. People have a little opportunity to cook at home, because most family members are busy in professional job life. Cooking at home is a time consuming and diligent task. After a day hard work, It will be the most convenient choice for them to have a fast food as meal rather than cooking. For Instance, both my wife and I should stay out of home from morning to evening for our daily office works, and after a day tireless works we barely could cook for us. Thus we prefer to have fast food at mealtime rather than cooking. In addition, having fast food is an opening for the person who wants to amuse himself by altering usual meal flavor. People could get bored after long time enjoying same tastes meal, and enjoying fast food offers them a new experience.

However, I would argue that these benefits are outweighed by the drawbacks. Most fast food items have little nutriment value. Its contain sugar, cholesterol and salt component which are extremely detrimental for individual well being. Eating fast foods daily will make us have diabetes or gain obesity. The rise in overweight population has also been linked to these eating habits. Another downside is that many restaurants food processing systems are not hygienic. They have mixed different kinds of preservatives and chemical during cooking stages which are unhealthy for human being. A recent survey shows that in Bangladesh 40% restaurants are using chemicals for food preparation which could be initiate the risk of diseases like cancer, diabetes, heart attack. Furthermore, the price of fast foods is more expensive, so it could enhance our daily living cost.

In conclusion, it seems to me that the potential dangers of fast foods are more significant than the possible benefits. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,5.5
"With an increasing number of people eating fast food, which if eating too regularly can cause health issues, some people think that the only solution is to ban it completely. To what extent do you agree?","Nowadays, growing population, especially youth, is eating junk food on a regular basis. It can lead to various health problems. Some people are of the opinion that the only way to solve this problem is to ban it. This essay will talk about why this is not a viable solution according to me.

Let us understand the reason, why more number of people are opting for junk food. Fast food, the name itself indicates it is not only available very quickly, but also cheap. For instance, in metro cities, where people are working almost throughout the day, they tend to eat fast food to save their precious time and money. Apart from this, the younger generation of the country tends to follow the Western culture, junk food chains like Mc Donald’s being one of them.

Consuming such junk food on a daily basis will lead to different health problems as they contain lot of preservatives and fats. It can mainly cause a person to become overweight leading to issues like obesity, high cholesterol levels, etc. According to me, banning anything leads to the illegal selling of the banned item. If fast food is banned it will cause people to buy them at higher costs maybe illegally. Instead, health awareness must be done about eating healthy food rather than fast food.

To conclude, I do not completely agree that fast food should be banned to avoid its consumption on a large scale. In my opinion, we should rather focus on the advantages of eating healthy food and promote the same on a large scale. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6.5
"in some countries, an increasing number of people are suffering from health problems as a result of eating too much fast food. It is therefore necessary for the government to impose a higher tax on this kind of food. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?","The extreme consumption of fast food has been a thorny issue making more and more folks bear with health diseases over years in numerous regions. Although it is thought that imposing a higher tax on junk food is crucial for authorities, I am particularly against the idea.

On the one hand, there are many advantages for governments to raise the fast-food tax. Due to high expenses, inhabitants are less likely to consume junk food frequently. Boosting taxes discourage citizens to purchase convenience food, therefore, they have no option but neither buying healthy food not cooking a proper meal to save their money. Furthermore, the amount of money derived from charging junk food could be used to minimize the negative impact caused by absorbing excessive ready-to-go food. For instance, the authorities can use the expenditure in hospitality to help patients who are coping with diseases such as obesity and heart disease.

On the other hand, assessing hunger tax is needless as people might maintain a fast-food diet. Firstly, the middle and lower-income class would be affected by the extra fee while the affluent residents are immune. Secondly, knowing the detriment effect of fast food, many people still take up ready-to-go meals owing to its convenience. According to some news, the former US president, Donald Trump, usually eats one McDonald's meal a day to save time for working. Perhaps a feasible approach for the government is to make healthy food more affordable and accessible to their dwellers.

In conclusion, I strongly disapprove of enhancing the tax on fast food to reduce health issues despite the benefits of that idea. Hence, better attempts should be used to tackle the problem. ",Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,7
should government put more taxes on fast food as they are not good for health? Discuss and give your opinion.,"Junk foods are readily available nowadays and many people consider it to be the primary reason behind the overweightness of certain individuals in the community. Therefore, there has always been a question, whether the authorities should levy additional charges on these unhealthy foods? In my perspective, they should focus on alternative solutions rather than increasing the taxes.

To embark on, fast food is mostly being consumed by rich and middle-class residents. If the extra charges are imposed on people, it would not affect the higher financial class. Hence, even after have to pay additional taxes, they would continue having these in their diet. However, middle income citizens would suffer from such action. People with urge to eat such foods would not reduce their consumption but instead it would put a big hole in their pocket. Moreover, restaurant owners would be burdened by these steps. Hence, they will be suffering by paying heavy duties.

Considering the aforementioned, approaching this problem more practically can offer better results. Young students should be taught about the severe consequences of having excess of such unprocessed food in their respective academic institutions. When they are made aware about the side effects from a very early age, then they would be able to differentiate between healthy and unhealthy food. In addition to it, governing bodies should try to run the awareness drives for their citizens to help them understand about the benefits of healthy eating habits.

In conclusion, there is no denying that junk food has become an indispensable part of the modern lifestyle of many persons. But, the problem should be approached more practically like by educating and awaring the masses rather than imposing additional taxes.",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6
In Some countries people are suffering from health problems. They eat a lot of fast food. It is therefore government should have to tax higher on this food. Do you agree or disagree ?,"It is an undeniable fact that the consumption of fast food is rising. Ample of individuals are suffering from multiple diseases such as obesity and diabetes. It is an accountability of government that they charge higher tax on this food. I, however, disagree with this statement. Reasons shall be discussed in the forthcoming paragraphs before reaching a reasoned conclusion.

There seem to be two main reasons stemming from this situation. To begin with, government should have to aware about exercise, which is essential to keep body fit. It is onus of government that they should foster humans walk 10, 000 steps regularly. Fast food, for instance, is famous among youngster community. Therefore, it is responsibility of schools that they render abundant of knowledge about diseases like blood pressure, thyroid, and teach them their side effects. Hence, if people have enough knowledge about diet, they can strive to avoid food and do regular exercises.

A second point in the favour of sceptics is that government should be straight about rules and regulations rather than impose higher taxes. If food council is checking food quality regularly in manufacturing companies, this problem can be easily solve. additionally, it is the responsibility of factories that they labble on all food products. Therefore, sectors, who suffers from medical condition that they can avoid to take.

To conclude, it is irrefutable fact that plenty of humans are suffered from various conditions. There are plethora of ways to solve this dilemma rather than charge higher tax on company. I would like to say that it is the individual's duty that they avoid fast food and burn their energy. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,5.5
CONSUMPTION OF FAST FOOD BY AUSTRALIAN TEENAGERS,"The provided line graph depicts a comparison between three categories of junk food consumption eaten by Australian teenagers over 25 years from 1975 to 2000. Overall, the consumption of fish and chips declined over the provided period, whereas the amount of pizza and hamburgers had an opposite trend.

In 1975, the amount of fish and chips peaked at 100 times per year, while the proportion of hamburgers and pizza at the same time were consumed approximately 5 times a year. However, apart from fluctuation from 1980 to 1985 before standing at roughly 95 times, the consumption of fish and chips has plummeted over the 25 years and was just under 40 in 2000.

An opposite picture is that the ratio of teenagers ate the other two types of fast foods was higher. The consumption of pizza increased insignificantly until it surpassed the fish and chips in 1990. Then, it reached a plateau from 1995 to 2000. The exponential increase was noticeable in the amount of hamburgers consumption from 1975 to 1985, predominating that of fish and chips during that period. It finished at the same rate as fish and chips began and stayed static with a consumption of 100 times per year. ",No,No,No,No,No,No,5.5
"Even though doctors believe that fast food is harmful to people's health, more and more people are eating it. What can cause this? How to solve this problem?","These days, the number of the people who prefer to eat fast food are increasing. Although doctors believe that, fast food impacts on individuals' health negatively, huamn beings are eating it more and more. In my opinion, even though there are various of factors which lead to this activity, they are not unsolvable. On the one hand, fast food is a thing which can be easily ready to serve and this is the main reason why the majority of individuals prefer it. For instance, especially workers try to find a food which easily get ready to consume, in their little lunch time. They can eat green vegetables, which contain the huge amount of calories, instead consuming harmful junk food. On the other hand, in currently period human beings tend to visit restaurants and clubs where fast food is served, and they find it delicious even knowing it causes main health problems to their organism. Solution for this is that, parents should show their children how not enough ready food is harmful for them and make them more likely to eat home-made meal. In conclusion, parents' factor plays essential role in preventing this problem among children. However, mature individuals should change their attitude to eat while they are searching for food in short time.",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,5
Many fast food industries impacts on climate and the health of people,"Whether fast-food companies have severe impacts on the climate, the health of people, and families, have developed a considerable debate these days. A school of thought believes that there is no such negative impact of the junk food industry on the environment and health. Nevertheless, I am of the opinion that such kinds of industries affect the overall environment as well as human health significantly.

Firstly, there are a plethora of severe side-effects of the consumption of junk foods, and recently many published reports supported this fact. The best example is a report of August 2021, published in a prestigious journal “Science” in which investigation was carried out over 2000 subjects for the analysis of harmful effects of junk foods. Unfortunately, the findings were so heart-breaking which revealed that almost 40% of participants who were habitual of fast foods, suffered from many deadly diseases such as heart attacks, sudden high blood pressure and cancer. Therefore, the rapid evolution of the fast-food industry has substantial negative effects on public health and eating habits.

Secondly, the emergence of these industries has unfavourable effects on the environment and climate. For instance, the application of various kinds of non-renewable materials in the packaging of fast foods deteriorates and damages the climate. In addition to this, the production of these foods at a large scale in these industries generates a lot of wastage and other unwanted products. Eventually, these are discarded to rivers and some specific locations which possess a great threat again to the environment. Hence, the development of these events and processes due to the food industry showed their unfavourable approach towards the environment and human health.

In conclusion, there are various threats by junk-food industries in terms of the public health, environment, and eating habits of the people. I believe that the threat to the environment could be managed and improved by employing the latest technology in industries. However, some other threats would not be reduced to the desired level.",Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6.5
Fast food is a bad for people health more people are eating it why why are more people eat fast food what can be about this problem,"It is often believed by some individual junk food is not worthwhile for individual health because it creates many health problem for individual life. In my opinion, I believe that it is mainly due to busy life and taste different variety of food, while with Proactive approach this can be overcome. One obvious reason why individual give preference to eat junk food is that they have busy schedule because most of individual live far away from their home for their work and study purpose owing to which they devote their most of the time on the work and study. Therefore, they have no enough time to prepare food at home due to which they are prefer to eat outside food, Secondly reason most of individual like to try new food as well as with the help of know about the different culture food items. There are are multifarious solution to solve this problem first and foremost government should organised camp for aware indivisible about the health problems which credited by the eating more junk food. Another solution is that government should reduce the working hours of individuals due to which people have time to prepare food at home. To conclude, although most of people give preference to outside Food because of less time and taste variety of food, I admit that this problem can be solved by government",No,No,Yes,No,No,No,5
Cooking is waste of time at home because nowadays fast food provide on a single click what extent do you agree or disagree,"In this revolutionized era, people are so busier these days owing to which it is being said that in contemporary, fast-food is more convenient as compared to homemade. Unarguably, I agree with this notion; however, its regular consumption will impose deleterious effects on health.

To start with, due to cut-throat competition, people nowadays are working around the clock and hence, running out of time to cook their food at home. Moreover, the husband is not only the breadwinner these days since the wife is also working to make both ends meet. As a result, with a single click, one can order fast food online on the doorstep. Furthermore, anybody can go outside to enjoy readymade food too even at lower rates as compared to homemade.

the sale of junk food in school cafeterias should be stopped,"Most people like junk food. It is considered as a popular choice whenever we

want to eat some delicious things. Pizza, soda, hamburger or fried chicken are replacing the nutritious foods on our menu, including the school cafeteria menu. Students have consumed a lot of junk food through school canteens or vending machines. Personally, I totally agree that the sale of junk food in school cafeterias should be stopped to encourage better eating habits.

Junk food is bad for our health and is related to many health problems. Most of

the junk foods are low in nutritional value but high in fat and sugar that directly

contribute to the obesity of students. Diabetes can also be caused by over consumption

of junk food. Because of the high volume of sugar, junk food makes our bodies stop

producing adequate insulin that is an important chemical for controlling blood sugar

levels. This will lead to Type 2 diabetes which is considered as a common reason for

death in modern life. Eating junk food affects bone and dental health. Growing students

need a dramatic amount of calcium for the development of bone and teeth, so foods

lacking calcium but reduntanting sugar like junk food should be replaced with more

nutritious options.

Another aspect of health problems resulting from junk food is student’s behavior.

Chemical additives making colors and flavors for food are usually used over quantity to

stimulate student’s tastes. They also lead to behavioural problems such as hyperactivity and poor concentration in students. Besides that, junk food can result in a decrease in brain activity. These toxic additives and preservatives have bad effects on thinking and cognition. Students cannot healthily grow or develop their studying potential with junk food over consumption. Schools should replace junk food with other better choices to make sure that their students will have the most nutritious meals.

In addition, waste is an issue that will be partly solved by the limitation of junk

food in schools. Its packaging is a significant contributor to the trash problem that

increases the expense of cleaning up litter at school and creates negative images in

public places. The majority of fast food is packaged in plastic packaging that must be

discarded after use. Unfortunately, many irresponsible students throw away this

packaging in areas other than rubbish bins. As a result, in order to reduce trash, the

selling of junk food in school canteens should be prohibited.

People say that junk food has some benefits such as being delicious, cheap,

convenient, and the nutrients in them are improving. However, these positive aspects

cannot be compared to a lot of disadvantages that junk food brings to students such as

obesity or overactivity. Their health is always the most important thing. Instead of using

this kind of food, schools should improve their student’s meals, which must be both

nutritious and delicious.

In conclusion, although junk food is a preferable source of food, it needs to be

stopped from being served in school cafeterias because of a lot of drawbacks. The sale

of junk food gives bad impacts on the health and behavior of students and creates more litter in schools. They still have appetizing and health-giving meals without junk food. ",No,No,No,No,No,No,5.5
Schools have the responsibility to discourage children from eating junk food. Others think it is parent's responsibility,"There is no doubt that these days fast food is becoming increasingly popular, and it is frequently consumed by children. Some people argue that it is the obligation of schools to dissuade children from eating this kind of food. Others feel that parents must take responsibility for their children's health. This paper will make a comparison between both arguments and draw my own conclusion.

In terms of some view, teachers and instructors should teach their students to avoid eating high-fat foods. The main reason given to support this claim is that children spend plenty of time in schools. To illustrate, if school administration eliminates carbohydrate-rich food from the canteen and replaces it with health food such as vegetables and fruits, students will develop eating habits that are healthy. It is undeniable that schools play an important influence in the health of children.

By contrast, those who oppose, think that toddlers should be taught how to begin a healthy diet by their parents. On explanation is that youngsters are more influenced by their parents than others, and hence can readily modify their dietary habits. An example can be seen in families who eat junk food several times a month may notice that their toddlers are obese and overweight, which has a detrimental impact on their children's lives. It is appears that education begins at home.

In conclusion, although schools should teach children about the benefits of eating natural, healthy and flavorful foods, I feel that it is the responsibility to educate children on diet awareness in order to healthy lifestyle",No,No,No,No,No,No,5.5
"Scientists generally agree that the consumption of junk food is detrimental to health. Some people believe that the answer to this problem is education. Others disagree, saying that it will not work. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Some researchers mostly find that the absorption of fast food is negative to human body. Many individuals are of the belief that the key to this issue is education, while others refuse and saying that it will not be effective. Although both schools of thought hold a certain degree of accuracy, I am with the latter view.

On the one hand, it is obviously true that education is the answer to this issue because people will know how to avoid junk food that are harmful to their health. First of all, schools will let people know the fact that fast food contains a lot of fat, oil, cholesterol, and so on, which can cause obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and other kind of diseases that are life-threatening. People would be afraid of that just simply because they are scared of facing the death, so they would stop consuming processed food. Therefore, solving health diseases that are related to junk food would need a very huge support from education.

On the other hand, although education would be a very great supporter for addressing health issues that related to readily made food, it will not be very effective as many people thought because of the fact that it also depends on finance and life’s factors. For instance, a disadvantaged-finance person would not have many opportunities to get to know about junk food that are bad for health, and they also do not have enough conditions to purchase ingredients to cook at home, they would buy processed food due to poverty and convenience. Thus, education will not be very efficacious for solving problems about the disadvantages of junk food.

To conclude, although education is a valuable assistant for helping people to avoid eating junk food, it is not really a key to that problem because there are many other factors that can affect to people’s eating habits. Therefore, I agree with the latter view instead of the former view.",Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6.5

Eating out on daily basis in less than 5% and the percentage of never buying readymate food is less than five percent. The habit did not change for the last 10 years.

Adevertisement of soft drinks and junk food which are meant to attract children should be banned . Do you agree or disaree.,"Many parents are not in fovour of advertisements of snacks and soft drinks which are meant to allure their off-spring as they fear that they will afflict, them however advertiser justify this citing that they provide some usefull information to the childrens. On a careful analysis, it can be seen that this sounds lame excuse and I agree with the writer’s notion and reason for my inclinationa are articulated in the trail paragraphs.

To begin with, manufactures of candies, biscuits, soft drinks produce attrative advertisements targeted at children. For instance, the TV broadcast alluring advertisements of these products intermittently from time to time through all channels. Since children are avid viewers of TV, they are drawn to such products and squanders of money on them, owing to such reasons to commericial of such help impairing products should be completely prohibited.

Another relevant argument which supports my inclination is that excessive and regular intake of sweets and soft drinks can lead to several health problems. The growing rate of obesity among children is the outcome of this practise. To quote an example, more than 60 percent of the US adolescents are obese, out of them 70 percent are the victims of overconsumption of fastfood that stands as an apitomy.

In a nutshell, attractive advertisements of soft drinks and junk food are capable of prompting young adults to consume harmful food, the claim of advertisers about providing some useful information to children dosenot alleviate the real problem. ",No,No,No,No,No,No,5.5
in some countries an increasing number of people are suffering from health problems as a result of eating too much fast food. It is therefore necessary for government to impose a higher tax on this kind of food. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"Nowadays, as a result of junk and processed foods, more people are affected by health issues. The government should intervene in this situation taxes on junk and impose heavy on fast food. In this essay, we will discuss both the statements and reach reasonable conclusion. To begin with, every people should be aware of their health. If they did not look at their health issues then it will affect us physically and mentally problems. Most of the people are suffering from obesity due to uncontrollable eating of fast food and lack of physical activities. It will tend to be diabetes, heart problem, and so on. Moreover, It leads to spend for hospitals in our daily. All things are considered, the government should improvise the taxes on fast food companies that automatically cost will increase and food in demand. But, this would not control many people from buying. For example, one of my friend is a smoker who used to buy cigarettes 10 for one day. Once a company increased the rate and tax that time he could not afford it. So, he reduced his smoking, and one day he will quit. Likewise, the government can make such decisions towards the reduction of Fast food companies for the sake of peoples health illnesses. These would change the people minds to control of buying preservative foods. To conclude, in my view, people are suffering from health problems rapidly due to fast food habits. So, it is necessary that government should take action towards the public health benefit. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,5
Nowadays the consumption of fast food is increasing day by day.,"Over the years, many people believe that the everywhere of fast food provides enough pleasure and economic benefits to outweigh its health effects. In my opinion, health related shortcomings lead to this negative development.

Proponents of the fast food industry typically point out that consumers enjoy it and that it provides employment. There is little to argue about enjoyment. Fast food is cheap and tastes great. This means its popularity and makes it convenient even for people with the lowest socioeconomic background. There are also clear economic benefits. Companies like McDonald’s, Burger King, Baskin Robbins and Domino’s Pizza are among the largest employers in the world. In addition to providing low-paying jobs with their economic costs, they are taxed and there by strengthen the federal budgets of developing and non-developing countries.

Nevertheless, fast food has a major impact on food health. Most clearly, this applies to obesity. Studies have shown that obesity is on the rise in countries where fast food has entered the local market. The best known example of this is in the United States, where obesity is reaching epidemic levels. Associated and often symptomatic deficiencies include cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure. Foods rich in fat, sugar and over-processed ingredients have been proven to worsen this condition, with heart disease currently the single leading cause of death worldwide. This can’t be blamed on a full fast food, but there are very few useful options on the fast food menu and most companies specialize in junk foods like deep fried chicken, cheeseburger, pizza and taco.

In conclusion, despite the benefits to taste and economy, fast food is generally negative considering its impact on food well-being. It is therefore important to regulate them to limit the impact of fast food companies.",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,5
Causes and Effects of the Popularity of Fast Food Restaurants,"In this day and age, the number of fast food restaurants have a tendency to become increasingly viral than before. They are available in the malls and strategic places. This essay will clarify the reasons for the popularity of fast food restaurants then simultaneously describe the possible effects of this issue.

In my perspective, the foremost cause is residents’ life has been constantly being tiring these days. On the ground both husband and wife are tied up with their work, they have no choice but to eat out at fast food restaurants due to lack of cooking time. Moreover, people are likely to work full days with limited time of break which results in fast food becoming their top priority.

When it comes to fast food, not only adults but the younger generation also tends to consume a large amount of fast food for its tasty flavor. Fast food is believed to be delicious, attractive and especially affordable for youngsters. It is common to come across teenagers eating fast food everywhere which is another note-worthy factor that leads to the increase in the number of fast food restaurants.

Besides its popularity, fast food has some negative impacts on human health. A large amount of calories from refined sugar and fats was found in fast food. Nevertheless, it is also high in sodium from salt and other additives which can be the reason why consumers eat it more frequently. Consuming more calories than human needs can cause obesity and also some health problems such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease and even cancer.

In the light of the above-mentioned, popularity of fast-food restaurants is undeniable. It is caused by the lifestyle of modern people, both adults and youngsters.

"In recent years, eating fast food has become more and more popular. Many people believe that eating fast food is harmful to health. Others think that it is a good choice for busy people. There are both advantages and disadvantages, the following essay will discuss both points of view in detail","In recent years, eating fast food has become more and more popular. Many people believe that eating fast food is harmful to health. Others think that it is a good choice for busy people. There are both advantages and disadvantages, the following essay will discuss both points of view in detail.

There are some main advantages to eating fast food. First, fast food is convenient for office workers and busy people. They work very hard and they don’t have time to cook during lunch break, so they can order fast food to take advantage of work. Second, fast food has many types, flavors and most of them are easy to eat. You can eat one dish a day, one taste a day and it is very easy to buy at the market or store near your house. Nowadays, fast food is popular and attractive to people of all ages because everyone can eat it every day.

However, there are some disadvantages to eating fast food. First, fast food is harmful to health. For example, if you eat fast food every day, you will be at risk of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Besides, there are intestinal diseases and food safety is not guaranteed. You do not know its origin and production method so leads to poisoning. Some fast foods sold on the sidewalk will be dirty.

In short, there are both advantages and disadvantages to eating fast food. In my opinion, eating fast food has more drawbacks than benefits. Each person should limit eating fast food and eating more vegetables, fruits to improve health. ",No,No,No,No,No,No,5.5
Some people argue that there is a much wider benefit of eating. Others believe that they have some drawbacks of eating fast food. The following essay will discuss both points of view in detail.,"Recently, many people enjoy eating fast food because it is convenient for having a meal. Some people argue that there is a much wider benefit of eating. Others believe that they have some drawbacks of eating fast food. The following essay will discuss both points of view in detail.

There are many people who prefer eating fast food in spite of having a meal at home. They believe that fast food is playing a larger role in contemporary society. The first advantage of having fast food is that it saves time for lunch or supper. Workers and students go out of their homes and they do not have enough time to prepare meals. Further, the eaters can eat during work. Therefore, it is more convenient for them to eat. Even so, the price is not cheap. For instance, a recent survey has indicated that the number of young eaters has had a significant increase with over 70 per cent in recent years.

Whereas, others believe that fast food is a cause of some health dilemmas. I personally agree with this argument. Some researches have shown that fast food contains a high level of fat, which is a cause of being overweight. Obesity is a major issue that many people are concerned about in modern society. For instance, a recent research has indicated that a half of young people who are overweight.

In conclusion, fast food has a more important role in modern society but I would emphasize that fast food has disadvantages than its advantages. I believe that we should try to find a balance between fast food and homemade food because fast food is a main cause of obesity. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,5.5
causes and effects on overconsumption of fast food in children,"It is undoubted that unhealthy food, namely junk food and convenient snacks, are becoming more prevalent in the modern era, especially to teenagers. According to statistics, numerous young generations all over the world tend to consume a significant amount of that unhealthy food. This essay is going to figure out the causes as well as the negative consequences relates to this tendency.

It is obvious that the appearance of fast food advertisements is one of the key factors leading to the overconsumption of that unhealthy food. In effect, these advertisements usually attract a large portion of children by applying eye-biding images and offering several good promotions. Associating unbeatable prices with complimentary gifts is the wise tactic of fast food outlets to appeal to young customers about choosing fast food over healthy homemade one. Particularly, as a matter of fact, KFC advertisements generally attract children’s attention by applying vivid images to boost their popular fried chickens. Obtaining a free toy when customers purchase in the combo is the top reason leading youngsters to consume a big portion.

While the occasional night of junk food won’t hurt much, eating junk food regularly or overconsumption has been shown to cause numerous adverse impacts on human health. According to certain scientific researches, not only do junk foods have relatively low nutritional value but it also comprises a significantly high amount of calories and fat content. This is one of the most reasons why junk food tends to increase the risks of obesity, high blood pressure, and heart diseases as well. For instance, it is obvious that fried chicken at KFC is genuinely appealing due to its flavors. Nevertheless, the more an individual consumes this kind of fast food, the more health issues they may undergo. Furthermore, the mere intake of fast food instead of proper sit-down meals is the remarkable factor directly affecting the bond of the family. Instead of spending time in the kitchen and at a grocery store preparing a meal, individuals can spend mere minutes at a fast-food restaurant. Undoubtedly, with those fast-food meals, they could eat anywhere at any time, even in their cars. Due to this, proper sit-down meals with family seems to vanish gradually. As a consequence, members of a family do not have opportunities to talk, interact or even exchange stories with each other.

In conclusion, it is clear that there are various reasons for children consuming significantly more junk food. As a result, the downside would emerge consequently in terms of health. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6
ensuring that children have regular physical exercise should be the responsibility of parents and therefore schools should not waste valuable school time having sports lessons as part of the curriculum. To what extent do you agree?,"How can we assure that students actively participate in physical exercises? Some people hold a view that sport lessons in schools should be eliminated while parents can be responsible for arranging related activities. I completely disagree with this opinion for the following reasons.

Firstly, attending physical curriculum provides an opportunity for teachers to unveil children’s talents in sports. Many students who perform poorly on traditional core subjects might have enormous potential in achieving athletic success. For instance, as a remarkable basketball player, Michael Jordan was discovered by his school coach and consequently obtained tremendous achievements in sports industry. Nevertheless, if Michael Jordan did not attend sports classes and was not encouraged by his PE teacher, he would have struggled on passing traditional subjects for graduation and would not be accepted by well-known university for his natural endowment in sports.

Besides, taking sports lessons allows children to relax from tense academic studies. As many students are compulsively required to attain acceptable on core subjects to graduate and to be enrolled in famous universities, children usually spend tremendous time studying traditional courses and feel stressed. Whereas if sports lessons are properly arranged for children, they will have time to play with their peers and will ease down from onerous academic study. Moreover, since parents already lay much focus on heavy workloads, there is less time to ensure children’s zealous participation in physical exercises.

In conclusion, as students’ athletic potential can be explored by teachers from sports schools and children are provided arranged time to decompress from heavy academic studies. Therefore, cutting down sports courses should be reconsidered. ",Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,7
The increasing use of air transport to export fruit and vegetables to countries where they cannot be grown or are out of season is a positive development. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"With the growth in aviation, many countries now choose this mode of transport to export food such as fruit and vegetables to places where they are not in season or cannot be grown. I do not believe that this has been a positive development for the following reasons. The first is the negative impacts that this has on th e environment. One of the biggest problems in the world today is global warming, and one of the major contributors to this is the burning of fossil fuels in the form of oil. Transporting millions of tonnes of food every day by air will add significantly to this problem as just one flight releases large amounts of carbon dioxide and other gases into the environment.  Another reason is the effect this can have on local markets. Using planes to transport food means that it can be exported in bulk, and it is la rge chains of supermarkets that usually use such methods. They can then sell it at discount prices to customers and provide a great deal of choice. Local farmers, on the other hand, cannot reduce their prices and they can only sell the fruits and vegetable s that are in season. This means that they cannot compete in the market and may lose business or their business may fail.  To conclude, the detrimental effect that importing food by air has on the environment and local markets means that this is not sustai nable. Measures should be taken to encourage local farming and reduce the dependency on exported food. ",No,No,Yes,No,No,No,5
"Some say that sports play an important role in society. Others, however, think that it is nothing more than a leisure activity.","Some would argue that playing sport is simply an activity that people do as an exercise, while others believe that sport has a significant effect on society and people’s life. While training and playing sport can merely leisure, but I assume that sport does have an important function in society.

On the one hand, nobody can deny that sport is a great leisure activity. The majority of people all around the world participate in sporting activities every day because of the sense of well-being and relaxation that it brings them. People play sport for numerous reasons, including, wanting to get fit or stay in shape, as a way to take their mind off the stress of daily life. For instance, my wife has a regular plan to go to the gym to do exercise because she has a stressful job and this kind of activities help her to decline the stress. I believe that sport plays a vital role at present in society in comparison with relaxation and getting fit.

On the other hand, the sport has so many advantages and It does serve a number of usual functions within society. Sport creates healthier societies. People who play sport are known to be happier and healthier, and less prone to certain mental and physical illness, which reduces the burdens on healthcare systems. Sport also brings people together and creates a sense of unity within societies. This can be witnessed when complete strangers join together to cheer on and support their countries football team. For example, in my own country, whenever our national football team plays with another country, men, women and children get together to support our team and give them a positive sense. I presume that sport has a crucial function and position in societies.

In conclusion, It is true some think that sport just is leisure, but I believe that playing sport has more advantages than exercise for people’s life and societies. ",No,No,Yes,No,No,No,5.5
"Some people believe that physical fitness of strong individuals and teams is the reason for most sports achievements. Others, however, think that mental attitude is more important. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","It is irrefutably true that achievements in the sports are the result of hard work, talent and strong commitment. However, some people say that physical fitness of sports players plays a key role to make massive accomplishments in the sports. By contrast, others claim mental attitude as the most salient factor behind sports achievements. Here, I would like to account for both sides with my own perception.

There are manifold points to endorse the former view. First and foremost, players with sound physical fitness can put their hundred percent efforts for the victory of their team. Their performance looks extraordinary when they are good at fitness. Taking a real life example into consideration, once in a cricket match, a top class batsman Hershel Gibbs was playing exceptionally well against India. His team was very close to victory but unfortunately, he got injured while running for a single. Later, he was unable to take singles and got out while playing a big shot. This turned his team to lose the final match by only two runs. Hence, achievements in the crucial matches and tournaments depend a lot on the physical fitness of best players. On the contrary, others have conflicting views.

They think that a robust mental attitude lays down the foundation of achievements in sports. Without strong mentality and positive attitude, making achievements seems a herculean task. To make it clear with one more real life example, South African cricket team is one of the best cricket teams in the world but they have never won any World Cup just because of less strong mental attitude or temperament. Many many times, it is noticed by the cricket fans and experts that the players of South Africa are unable to bear the pressure of big games and become mentally depressed under pressure situations. This results in quick loss of wickets and game over for African team. Consequently, mentally strong players are much needed to win awards in the sports.

To recapitulate, undeniably, physical fitness has it’s own importance. However, in my opinion, a positive mind set up with the passion to win brings a massive success in sports. ",No,No,No,No,No,No,5.5

"Some teenagers take part in different kinds of activities such as musical classes, sports classes and so on, but others only focus on one activity which is important to them. Which idea do you support?","It is critically important for people to develop skills in various fields to shape their lives. To be specific, teens should be active in multiple programs to enhance their competence rather than keen on a specific area. I think teens are enthusiastic to participate in different types of activities to enhance their creative skills and relieve from the stress.

First of all, teens who are involved in multiple tasks like music classes or sports classes tends to be more creative. This means different activities allow young people to express themselves and increase their thought process. For instance, during my sophomore year, I took part in Karnatic music where I learned different notes and chords. With the help of those principles, I practiced myself to try something original and unique, so I worked on different tunes to bring the best out of me. Thus, not only I tried to create a distinct style but also composed my own new themes. Thereby, music classes aided me to increase my critical thinking which is crucial for learning process in the long-run. Had I not enrolled in the music class; I would have missed an opportunity to be more imaginative.

Second of all, teens would rather relieve their stress by participating in variety of activities than working on one specific task. As young people are strained with academic tasks or work burden, they can get some relaxation by playing a violin or running on a treadmill. These activities will release endorphins which make humans happier and free from tensions. Consequently, with stress-free environment teens can be prolific. For example, during my second year, I had to complete my course work and prepare for the exams parallelly. At that time, I joined in violin classes and swimming classes to divert my mind from other things. Therefore, whenever I was stressed or in a low mood, I would either play my violin or go to swimming because I was immersed in those things which cheers me up from the pressured environment.

In essence, I think taking part in distinct fields allow young people to be more thoughtful and stress-free. Which is why, I agree with the environment. ",No,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5
Popular events like the Football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tension and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way.,"Every four years, the whole world stops to watch international sporting events such as the Olympics and the Football World Cup in which athletes show their best performance to make their country proud. These sporting occasions have proved to be helpful in easing international tension in difficult times when powerful leaders were trying to control the world’s economy and other governments were fighting over the land. The Olympic Games are one of the best examples which prove how sporting events can bring nations together, at least temporarily. From the ancient History, when Greeks and Romans would interrupt battles to participate in the games, to the more recent international disputes, when athletes from Palestine and Israel would forget their differences, compete peacefully and even embrace each other after an event. Moreover, these popular events have called the world’s attention to the terrible consequences of wars; thus some leaders have tried to reach agreements to end their disputes and live peacefully.

Similarly, international sporting events show benefits in some developing countries which live in a daily internal civil war. For example, Brazil has a high rate of unemployment, lack of education, hunger, crime, poverty and corruption which leads to an immense embarrassment of being Brazilian and a low self-esteem. However, when the Football World Cup starts, the Brazilian squad, which is considered the best team in the world, provokes an amazing feeling of pride in their country. Most people seem to forget all their problems and even the criminal activity decreases. They paint roads with the national colors, wear the Brazilian team shirts and buy national flags. Moreover, the competition brings families and neighbors together and even rival gangs watch the games and celebrate peacefully.

In conclusion, popular sporting events play an important role in decreasing international tensions and liberating patriotic feelings as history has shown. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,5.5
People now have the freedom to work and live anywhere in the world due to the development of communication technology and transportation. Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?,"This essay suggests that the advantages of this phenomenon, which are freedom of choice in education and having a chance of better life standards, outweigh the disadvantages of it, mainly losing the culture of your home country. The freedom to work and live anywhere in the world, provides individuals to educate in better countries and schools. In this era, worldwide high-quality education becomes the most popular thing with easy transportation and communication for people who are looking to develop themselves. If they do not have enough facilities and opportunities to develop themselves on their degrees, they are looking for a country which have high quality and more facilities. Latest researches showed that, number of students who go abroad for better education has increased significantly during past twenty years.

Admittedly, when people work and settle abroad, it has some detrimental effects on the society. People seem to be ignorant of the cultural values, and instead of serving their own country, they are bended by the monetary benefits offered by the foreign country. If people move to various parts of the world, society as a whole becomes increasingly disjointed and fragmented. Moreover, instead of getting care from their grandparents, children of immigrant families are taken care of by baby sitters and after-school child care.

To conclude, in my opinion, the benefits of getting employed and settling abroad eclipse the minor drawbacks it brings. People get not only better job opportunity, but also better standard of living with the improvement of communication technology and transportation. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,5
Many people want their country to host an international sporting event. Other believes that international sporting events bring more problems than benefits. Discuss both the view and give opinion.,"In this concurrent era, arranging athletic event are ubiquitous across the globe. Some believe that it creates many dilemmas. While, I side with those who feel that country should organize international sport competition.

On the one hand it could be argued that international Olympics convey many problems. Some individual claim that the host countries have to spend ample amount of money to plan these events due to that sometimes governments borrow money from bank. What is more, it could also argue that when hosting an international sporting event is when spectators come to watch live event but after completing event they leave numerous amount of litter around the street of the hosting which deteriorate the beauty to the place and surrounding as well.

However, I feel that organizing the international sports have massive advantages. Firstly, it helps to grow tourism industries because many sports fan come to watch live event across the world and they know more about the particular country who held international events and also visit other places which leads to enhance tourism and employment as well. Take for instance; Australia 2011 Olympics drew in thousands of sports lovers which ultimately made the country benefit a lot in terms of employing large number of people and receiving big number of revenues from selling tickets.

In conclusion, although many may believe that arranging sports event leading many problems like spoil environment and places where event held, while it helps to expand hospitality sector and occupation. Therefore, on balance, I strongly believe international athlete beneficial for host country. ",Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6.5
"Some people believe that unpaid community service should be a compulsory part of high school programmes (for example working for a charity, improving the neighbourhood or teaching sports to younger children.)","There are often issues with understanding the vocabulary in this question, namely the

‘unpaid’, ‘community service’, ‘compulsory’ and ‘charity’ parts. ‘Unpaid’ is often paraphrased with ‘voluntary’ but this is not exactly the same and even contradicts the compulsory’ part of the question. ‘Voluntary’ means that one does the work without being paid but also chooses to do it because he wants to. ‘Compulsory’, on the other hand, means that the teenagers would not have any choice about doing the work; community service would be part of their high school duties as much as attending Maths classes is. Regarding ‘community service’, this is about doing work to benefit one’s community or

whichever community a person is a part of. Doing work for ‘a charity’ relates to helping

people regardless of where or who they are i. e. these people could be in another city or

country. The ‘charity’ work given in the question is an example of community service and

thus should not be the focus of the answer. If you would like more clarification about these

key words of the question, please see the vocabulary list.

Apart from this, I’ve noticed many students having difficulties with explaining their ideas in

the body paragraphs. Often, they will be vague in their explanations or give benefits of

doing community work which are not clearly unique to this type of work. For example, one

might argue that the teenagers could learn how to work as part of a team from doing

community service. This skill is not unique to this kind of work, however, and is something

they would likely learn from school (while doing project-type activities for instance or

playing sports). For this problem, I recommend using examples of real community service

work and being specific. For instance, “if a teenager helps the elderly people in a retirement

home, they will learn nursing skills. This is something they would likely not learn at school. ”",No,No,No,No,No,No,5.5
"Some people think that it is fine for professional sportsmen and sportswomen to misbehave on or off the field, as long as they are playing well. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?","What if professional sportsperson would not treat in a good way to individuals? Is it heathy phenomenon for healthy society? As a matter of fact, many a man, more often than not believe that no matter how is behaviour of famous players towards other during their personal as well as professional life as they are successful players. however, I am not in the favour of this statement because of several reasons that I am going to elaborate in forthcoming paragraphs.

Arguably, everyone earns name and fame just because of love of audience and followers. As youngsters has more inclined towards sports, consequently, it takes no time to become sportsmen and women their role models. Owing to role models, they start to follow their footsteps and do copy to them in their real life. If those sportspersons do not behave as a good human being, it would huge lose for society in a long run. A painstaking research has had been undertaken recently which disclosed that two-third young people follow sportsperson as their role model rather than other well-known personalities.

Apart from this, it could be great lose for their professional life as well because after facing this kind of behaviour, people would start to unfollow them. Hence, their profession may be in danger. Moreover, followers can be emotionally hurt after treating in such way by their loving sportsperson.

In conclusion, despite misbehave with someone, players should be come across with audience as a good person, it would definitely lead to personally stable and professionally enriching lives; lest good outcomes should be far out of reach. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,5.5
"You should spend about 40 minutes on this task. Some people think that physical strength is important for success in sport, while other people think that mental strength is more important. Discuss both views and give your own opinion. You should write at least 250 words.","Opinions about the way of being successful in sports are varied. Some people believe that physical strength is a relevant characteristic to achieve success. However, others consider mental strength to have a higher importance. In my opinion, both strengths are equally important and provide players with skills to succeed.

On the one hand, physical strength is thought to be an important factor to be successful in sports. This belief can relate to the idea that athletes spend a lot of time working out at the gym, so their resistance is better. For instance, being a physically active person allows players to remain active during a football match. Therefore, they stay focused on the game, and not on feeling tired.

On the other hand, mental strength is considered to be more relevant than physical strength. We may have heard the idea that the human mind is powerful, and in sports it plays a big role. This happens because being clever enough helps people to wisely predict their opponent’s movements. As a result, actions will be taken considering these predictions. If these ideas turn to be right, there will be a higher possibility to win.

Regarding my point of view, it is essential to develop both strengths to have a better performance in a sport. In fact, characteristics like having a strong mind and a strong body complement each other. For example, when basketball players are smart, they will manage to understand the other team’s plans. Also, if they often work out at the gym, they will not get tired easily during the match.

All in all, having a strong physic helps people to stay active in demanding sports such as football or basketball. In addition, having a strong mind makes players aware of their opponent’s ideas. When these strengths are combined, they create a successful atmosphere. ",No,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5
"Some people think that physical strength is important for success in sport, while other people think that mental strength is more important. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","In recent years, it is possible to recognize that crime novels and TV dramas are part of our daily lives. It means that people can find advertisement of these pieces of art in libraries or whenever they watch television. I will discuss why they have reached such popularity and provide my thoughts.

To begin with, several people enjoy spending their free time on activities that challenge their minds. This is precisely what crime novels and dramas allows them to do. For instance, when reading a crime story one always wants to discover who the murderer was. Therefore, attention is focused on understanding the clues given by the writer. In addition, this material is not difficult to access. It can be found in libraries or on different streaming services. In fact, even when people use the pubic transport, they can easily read or watch them. All in all, the fact that these novels and TV shows are mind-challengig and accessible has made them so popular in our society.

As far as I am concerned, this leisure material is a useful tool. First of all, it can boost people’s creativity because the stories allow their mind to be active. This may result on people becoming better at problem solving. Nonetheless, if it is used by children, it is essential that parents supervise this activity. Sometimes crime scenes might be shocking for the youth, so parents should guide them and explain what fiction and non-fiction is.

To conclude, crime novels and TV crime dramas have increased their popularity due to their features. In addition, they have some advantages for people’s lives. However, it is important to consider whether they appropriate for the young public or not. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6.5
"Tourism today creates a variety of problems, such as pollution due to flights, transport and dirty water. Do you think that governments should impose extra taxes on flights or accommodation to restrict today’s tourism industry? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience","Travelling today is simple to the extent that within twelve hours one can travel from Europe to Singapore, crossing nearly the whole globe. Based on this simplicity, tourism has changed significantly over the years. While in the past a family would be proud to drive two hours to a lake, many families now think nothing of travelling to the far side of the world. This also has a downside as increased pollution is a result. Extra taxes on flights or accommodation have therefore been offered as a solution so as to increase the cost of tourism and reduce its popularity.

No matter what major transportation is used, travelling creates pollution. To decrease the amount of pollution caused by tourism, the tourism industry itself would have to be weakened. If these increased taxes are based on travelling distance, people would be more willing to stay closer to their home country, as for many even a slight increase would mean that their planned holidays would be too expensive. Accommodation taxes would raise holiday costs no matter the distance travelled. Therefore, if increased taxes were levied on travel and accommodation, tourism and therefore pollution would decrease.

On the other hand, the main transport methods that would be impacted by imposing extra taxes would be communal ones, such as planes, trains and buses, and increasing the taxes would also impact non-tourists. Also, holidays are a vital part of ordinary people’s lives, as they escape from work and stress, and get to spend valuable time with their families. Stopping people travelling would greatly impact some simple pleasures of ordinary life.

In conclusion, while tourism impacts the environment significantly, simply introducing extra taxes on transport or accommodation is a drastic measure. It could be more valuable to change the methods of transportation to decrease pollution, instead making people stay close to home. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6
"Today, TV channels provide man's sport show more than women's sport show. Why? Should TV channel give equal time for women's sport and men's sport?","Multimedia entertainments such as TV channels prefer broadcasting man’s sport, and women’s sport is so little coverage. There are several likely reasons to explain, but the major argument is that men’s sport has the advantage of incumbency. In my opinion, media channels should give equal time for both.

The cause of the little media coverage in women’s sport is men’s sports have been reported for decades. It gains numerous advantages from this such as familiarity with audiences and loyalty that have developed among viewers. In addition, establishing business models on men’s sport can reduce the risks of failure, and stable cash flows allow them to continually advertise and promote their products. This progress in women’s sports leagues is extremely difficult to turn into a moneymaker. Secondly, the sporting marketplace is crowded, audiences pay much more attention to men’s football, cricket, and several other national sporting leagues. The other women’s sports such as swimming and football rate a little attention. There are also business linkages between some men’s sport and broadcast media, and the consequence is that women’s sport is trapped in cycles of neglect, little official funding, bad advertisement, and low levels of interest.

Besides that, coverage of women’s sport by media channels such as TV channel is not only the quantity of coverage but also reinforces gender stereotypes. One of the issues with coverage is that the global community undermines women’s achievements. The fact that women’s sport is more likely to be sexualized and women are more likely to emphasize sexuality in fundraising for their sport. Thus, media channels should declare that women’s sports achievements are also be respected as men’s sport, and not related to their sexuality.

In conclusion, subscription television sports channels have to give equal time to women's sport and men's sport. The increasing coverage of women’s sport is one of the potential outcomes for advertisements and promoting career path of women’s athletes.",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,5.5

Moreover, these popular events have called the world’s attention to the terrible consequences of wars; thus some leaders have tried to reach agreements to end their disputes and live peacefully.

Similarly, international sporting events show benefits in some developing countries which live in a daily internal civil war. For example, Brazil has a high rate of unemployment, lack of education, hunger, crime, poverty and corruption which leads to an immense embarrassment of being Brazilian and a low self-esteem. However, when the Football World Cup starts, the Brazilian squad, which is considered the best team in the world, provokes an amazing feeling of pride in their country. Most people seem to forget all their problems and even the criminal activity decreases. They paint roads with the national colors, wear the Brazilian team shirts and buy national flags. Moreover, the competition brings families and neighbors together and even rival gangs watch the games and celebrate peacefully.

In conclusion, popular sporting events play an important role in decreasing international tensions and liberating patriotic feelings as history has shown.",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,5.5
Modern Mode of Transport Vs Bicycles – Agree/Disagree,"In ancient times, people used to travel using bullocks, horsebacks, and many more which took a lot of time to complete their journey. Nowadays, with modern advancements in modes of transport, we can reach any place with ease. I agree with this notion without any qualms that modern modes of transport provide the best way to travel.

To a great extent I agree the above statement because, TV shows are nowadays made younger more lazy and irresponsible.

"In years to come, it was predicted that our major means of transportation will become automated. Not only that, people conveyed in these vehicles will also become passengers","In years to come, it was predicted that our major means of transportation will become automated. Not only that, people conveyed in these vehicles will also become passengers. It is the opinion of this essay that with this development, people will become more productive, reduces stress and human error will be eliminated wit fewer consequences such as inactivity and machine error. In the begining, the evolution of driverless means of transport promotes productivity as people will worry less about driving time to and from different locations. This will provide them with ample time to engage in other activities like time-out with family and their children. Furthermore, automation of vehicles help to reduce the stress involved in driving.

some people think funds must be used to develop rail tracks others think it is good to develop existing public transport. Discuss both views and give your opinion,"National expenditure for transportation is always an area of heavy debate. Few people think that funds should be channeled for developing the rail tracks, which benefits the connectivity with big cities, however, others believe that it must be used for strengthening the old system. In my opinion, it is more vital to renovate the existing transport.

Firstly, super fast trains ease the travel load among the cities and is beneficial in connecting with other nations. Long journeys tend to be experienced at our comfort. In addition, they are cheaper, safer and causes less pollution which is an added advantage. The journey time can be cut down when compared with other modes. The quality of infrastructure for swift electric trains reduces the dependency on other modes. For instance, Japan introduced the electric trains in their country which are consistently cutting down the burden on different means of transport.

On the other hand, public services cater diverse section of the society. The local transmission for the people both in rural and urban are the buses and roads which render them with easiest and flexible timings, where rail ways cannot reach. For example, India has three-quarter of majority in the rural areas increasing the dependency on less sophisticated modalities of transport. Moreover, buses travel to remote areas where it is difficult to access any means at any cost. Therefore, it is vital to devote funds for local transport.

In conclusion, though people opinion vary for National transport expenditure, it is extremely crucial to use it to improve the public transport before, drawing the attention towards building better tracks to suit for super fast trains. The plans for express trains can be reserved for the future. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6.5
public sports center or public hospital?,"As some argue that increasing the number of public sports facilities can improve people's health, people tend to think differently about one problem, while others have conflicting views that more public health facilities are needed to solve public health difficulties.

Meanwhile, fitness centers can provide various types of public amenities such as soccer fields and swimming pools, which allow many people to exercise comfortably and thereby develop their physical strength. Therefore, some people think that gyms are places that encourage the public to be physically and mentally healthy. For example, fitness centers in neighboring areas may help locality if they provide various types of recreation options. However, this option is not enough because the crisis is never simple in the current highly contagious pandemic situation, and related authorities have to focus on other issues.

On the other hand, most countries, especially developing countries, are facing serious crises in the public health sector. Therefore, the Ministry of Health should allocate considerable costs not only to build modernized hospitals and training centers, but also to introduce state-of-the-art technologies to diagnose diseases. Faced with financial constraints, it should be approached by the WHO and the UN, international organizations. In addition, those countries should devise public health insurance programs. They say that public medical facilities are a much more important problem than the fitness center.

In conclusion, in order to minimize personal health problems, the government must make efforts through various positions, such as investing in public hospitals and raising awareness of infectious diseases and epidemics.

However, the import of the product which public utilize for regularly are manufacture in alternative countries and then migrated these to far distance nation. In this essay, I will explore negative and positive in the forthcoming paragraphs. Whereas, due to this notion the disadvantage outweigh the advantage.

Firstly, the major disadvantage of this is air pollution. By this I mean that transportation through fleets of vehicle affect atmosphere. For instance, the truck prominently utilize for the export of goods as these work on diesel and petrol which emit fumes from exhaust as a result global warming occurs. In addition, this cause detrimental on environment.

Famous people working in the entertainment industry such as movie stars and sports figures are often paid millions of dollars in one single year. Many people think this is unfair while poverty is still a big problem. Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"It is a concerning fact that these days the individuals who work in entertainment are paid a huge salary. From my perspective, I partly assent to this point of view. Therefore, this essay will discuss the causes leading to this reality and explain why celebrities deserve to have a substantial income before coming to a reasonable conclusion.

To begin with, there are many understandable reasons why many entertainers such as movie stars, singers, and sports figures get a great deal of money. The primary reason is that the growing popularity of entertainment plays a pivotal role in the development of a country. For example, through movies, music videos, . . the entertainers bring an enormous motivation and inspiration to residents which help them relieve the stress after their hard-working day. In addition, the evolution of the entertainment industry brings a huge contribution to the improvement of a country’s reputation, which promotes this country’s image to the world. The celebrities who represent their country participate in the world's competitions which puts this country's entertainment industry on the world’s map. Furthermore, the main resource of the national budget is from the figure of the public who contribute the major portion to the country's total such as tax, entertainers’ income tax, . . . that help the quality of citizens’ life keeps improving. Another reason is that the celeb’s income not only reflects their amount of working time but also makes them practice as much as possible to maintain the positive professional images and their quality’s product keeps becoming better. For instance, individuals working in the entertainment industry have a busy working schedule until midnight while normal workers have a nine-to-five job. Therefore, there is no doubt that figures of the public should be paid a higher salary than other occupations.

On the other hand, it is claimed that the big names should have the as same as salary other people in other jobs. The major reason is that the high level of income disparities will pose a serious threat to the balance of the country's economy which is a leading contributor to the gap between the rich and people who have a meager income. As a result, people working in different employment will feel dissatisfied with their salaries that would lead to tensions and conflicts.

parents should spend more time with children doing what? sports and games or academic activities.,"In modern society, due to a hectic schedule, the vast majority of children are facing difficulties. For this reason, several parents endeavor to discover solutions for this issue. Although several options are provided, I strongly believe that parents should spend their time playing games or sports for several reasons. I will delineate my thoughts in the subsequent paragraphs.

To begin with, parents playing games with children can alleviate the stress they attain from their academic activities. Whereas the majority consider playing games inappropriate for children, I am a firm believer that playing games has positive aspects as it has negative effects on children. One of the positive aspects of playing games is that without the stress, children will display better academic performance. My own experience is a compelling demonstration to illustrate my point. When I was a child, I got so much stress from completing my daily assignments. Since I looked so exhausted, my dad suggested playing computer games with him. Through this opportunity, I disposed of all the stress because playing games with my dad was a special event was very fun. While I was playing games with my dad, I unexpectedly forgot all the pressure of homework provided by a rigorous teacher named Ding. In addition, without my dad's effort, I would not have received good grades.

On top of that, playing sports with parents is very beneficial in assorted ways. First, sports activities with parents will alleviate children's stress similar to playing games with parents. Second, Athletics will promote the health of both parents and children. My friend's child experience is the epitome to elaborate my opinion. His parents were very anxious about his obesity and endeavor to find a solution to solve the problem. Since his dad was a coach of the Korean national basketball team, his dad frequently played basketball with his father. As a result, he gradually lost weight and succeeded in going on a diet.

Some People Believe That The Fittest And Strongest Individuals And Teams Always Succeed in Sports,"It is opined by a few people that physical strength is crucial for winning the tough competition in sports whereas others believe that mental strength plays an equally significant role in achieving success in sports. In my opinion, it is the perfect blend of physical and mental fitness which helps an individual to face the challenges in the game and obtain victory.

Physical fitness is extremely important since any outdoor sport involves a lot of running, stretching and quick movements. Hence, a strong and flexible body is an added advantage.

Due to this, most of the sports men engage in rigorous physical activity to make themselves ready to face the opposite team in the game. For example, in most of the sports played at the international level, the selection of individual players representing the country is done based on the physical energy and stamina of the individual.

Even though physical strength has a vital role in success, the mental stability is equally important especially when playing a team game. Understanding and coordination among the individual team players is also required which is possible only if the players have a strong and mature mindset. The strategy to win a game demands persistence, consistent efforts and never say die attitude along with a goal-oriented approach. Research has shown that the cause behind the failure of a team in certain sports like cricket, football and hockey is the lack of team spirit. Due to these reasons, the mental health of the sports person is also taken into consideration when forming a team.

In conclusion, I feel that mental strength is as important as physical strength. The sports person should not only work on their physical fitness but also cultivate the right attitude. ",Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,7

Schools usually offer a variety of extracurricular programs including sports, the arts, technology, community services … There is a common belief that we should let students to choose themself what they want to do. However, I support the idea that sports programs should be mandatory for all students.

On the one hand, some people think that students should be free to decide their after-school activities. To be specific, students can choose the activities that they found interesting based on their preferences. It is also a great opportunity for students to explore their potential abilities and competences. For instance, children who take part in performing arts may grow up to be professional actors.

Nevertheless, there is a more persuasive argument that all students are required to play sports during their extra classroom programs. In fact, it is evident that physical activities are necessary for a healthy way of life, especially for children’s growth and development. Exercising can also improve focus, school performance, sleep and energy levels. When playing sports, chemicals in the brain are stimulated and make players feel better. So doing regularly physical activities improves students’ emotinal wellbeing. Moreover, studies have shown that sports have psychological benefits for children and adolescents and teach them important life skills. To illustrate, playing in a teams help young people to develop many social skills that they need for life: it teaches them to cooperate, to be less selfish, and to listen to others. When playing sports, children are also expected to follow the rules, to make new friends and build their social relationships.

In conclusion, involvement in extra-academic activities leads to positive long-term outcomes.

Following my mom’s instruction, I attended the institution and got interested in playing basketball. Form that time on, I initiated to play the sport with my friends every weekend. As a result, my weight began to reduce dramatically, and I eventually became healthy.

On top of that, generally speaking, sports require group work. For this reason, during the process of cooperation, students will improve their socializing skills. My brother, Isaac, is an archetype to elaborate on my opinion further. My brother in Gordon college was one of the members of a soccer club.

Do you agree that taking part in sports is important for an adult’s health and happiness. Discuss.,"One of the conspicuous trends of today’s world is the colossal in the increase in used of sports. There is widespread worry that this will only lead to a myriad of concerns in the society. In my opinion, sports has more negatives impacts than positive impacts in the society.

On one hand, critics may point out that one of the most significant benefits of taking not part in sports is important for an adult’s health and happiness. For example, research conducted in Sydney im the year 2014 has found that after the introduction of taking part in sports. There has been an increase of 80 percent in sports.

"Should sport be part of the school curriculum, or should it be left to the individual to organize? composition","Regular physical activity plays an essential life in a person’s life and helps us to stay both physically and emotionally healthy. Doctors all over the world raise the alarm about the degeneration of children health and physical conditions. Moreover, an increasing number of infants are suffering from obesity. Therefore I consider in my point of view sport should be part of the school curriculum as it provides colossal benefits to infants.

The greatest advantage of the sport is that it helps people to stay healthy and avoid illness.

One of the most important benefits is decreased risk of obesity which is a typical problem among modern kids. Sport improves the cardiovascular system, activities reduce c muscular tension, strengthen the lungs, reduce blood sugar levels and regulate blood pressure. People who are in sports are more energetic than those who are not going in for sport. A further advantage is that sport stimulates brain activity. Working out and regular exercises help improve your mental health. The high numbers of students who are in sport achieve better results in class. Finally, children who engage in sport are more social. Feeling a part of a team assists them to collaborate with their contemporaries.

Some sports like football, hockey basketball can be dangerous. Many injuries occur during exercises. Collisions and falls can hurt you. The other argument against is that sport in school is a waste of time. Playing sports is a physical activity that is added to the main lessons. Tiredness accumulates and can lead to fatigue, insomnia and even depression, as well as to frequent illnesses, as the child's body weakens. Also sports period might leave children with less time for academic subjects. As a result, some students might perform poorly in exams. Finally, students should choose what they want to do. Some people dislike sport. Every child should do the exercises that he can do and do the kind of sport that he likes.

Owing to sport infants can receive a lot of benefits such as excellent health, being fit and active. Additionally, they learn important life skills. ",No,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5
"Scientists predict in the near future cars will be driven by computers, not people. Why? Do you think it is a positive or negative development?","In the upcoming years, cars and other vehicles are projected to be driven automatically by computers. From my perspective, this phenomenon brings more advantages than disadvantages.

First, there are several driving forces behind this forecast. Steadily increasing budget from the government and giant corporations has brought about groundbreaking advances in robotics technology. The last few decades have witnessed robots gradually takes over manufacturing jobs previously done by human. Soon enough, automation will become a ubiquitous presence in our daily life, handling a variety of tasks including driving. In addition, given that traffic accidents are on the rise, especially in densely populated cities, self-driving cars could be the answer to reduce fatalities. Simply by taking human emotions and errors out of the equation, autopilot mode could indeed save millions of lives from car crash incidence.

Having said that, the benefits of autonomous cars certainly outweigh the drawbacks. Operated with a high degree of precision, self-driving vehicles can greatly reduce average commuter times in metropolitan areas, offering many spin-off advantages from well-being to boosting the economy. Besides, with driverless cars able to access up-to-the-minute data to help monitor traffic, as well as digital maps and other tools, they could determine the fastest, most efficient route possible. All of this will result in less congestion, less time-consuming and fuel waste.

In short, growing level of automation in this modern era is inevitable. More specifically, the emergence of self-driving technology is around the corner and despite initial concerns, this should be perceived as a positive trend.",No,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5

Indeed, this fast connection along with improving the transportation system has assisted to boost international trade, growth of the global economy, and in summary, led to the development of more and more nations in all fields. To illustrate this, in the past, businessmen for marketing the local goods internationally, irrespective of wasting huge time and energy, rarely received all markets. While today not only does all commerce access whole world markets but also transactions are done quickly and without any requirement for traveling.

On the other hand, it should be taken into consideration the negative side of this progress. Simply put, telecommunications has been gradually eliminating face-to-face relationships and converting individuals into an isolated person. According to psychological researchers, this is more likely to damage society due to the fact of the increasing criminal aspects of this manner of life. Also, in terms of the travel industry, it is obvious that through this boom accelerating the destruction of the environment and annoying traffic congestion are tangible.

Overall, although it seems these developments are hard on societies, advantages them are noticeable and have been serving mankind noticeably. ",Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6
"The government cannot fund all research projects because its budget is limited; therefore, some people insist that only research pertaining to the field of science and technology should receive government funding.","The government cannot fund all research projects because its budget is limited; therefore, some people insist that only research pertaining to the field of science and technology should receive government funding. While I do admit that scientific research should receive maximum funding, I totally disagree with the argument that the government should stop funding research in less ‘useful’ fields like arts or history.

Scientific research certainly provides tremendous value because scientific innovations have the power to change our lives for good. Take, for instance, the invention of the antibiotic. This wonder drug saved the lives of millions of people and continues to be a major lifesaver even today. The computer is also the result of scientific research. This invention changed the way we work and store information. Today, it is impossible to imagine a world without computers. Other inventions like electricity, motor vehicles and home appliances have also revolutionized our lives.

However, just because scientific research provides more value it does not mean that research in other ‘less useful’ fields should be discouraged. Of course, archeological research or research into the origin of languages is unlikely to have a massive impact on our day-to-day life. Yet, this information is crucial for understanding how we reached where we are today. The truth is that there are still a lot of things we can learn from previous generations. These kinds of research may even lead us to a common ancestor and that might put an end to the hostility prevailing between many nations. Historical research also teaches us about mistakes we must not repeat. The World Wars and the Genocide are two examples. Research on these horrific incidents keeps reminding us about the extent of damage they caused. If future generations do not learn about them, they might be tempted to commit the same mistakes again.

To conclude, not only scientific research but research in other fields also provides great value. Therefore, the argument that only scientific research should receive government funding does not hold water. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,5.5
Some people believe that technology has made man more social. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"Experts throughout both the developing and developed world have debated whether the advent of sophisticated modern technology such as mobile phones, laptops and iPad have helped to enhance and improve people’s social lives or whether the opposite has become the case. Personally, I strongly advocate the former view. This essay will discuss both sides using examples from the UK government and Oxford University to demonstrate points and prove arguments.

On the one hand there is ample, powerful, almost daily evidence that such technology can be detrimental especially to the younger generation who are more easily affected by it’s addictive nature and which can result in people feeling more isolated from the society. The central reason behind this is twofold, firstly, the invention of online social media sites and apps, such as Twitter and Facebook have reduced crucial face-to-face interactions dramatically. Through use of these appealing and attractive mediums, people feel in touch and connected yet lack key social skills and the ability to communicate. Secondly, dependence on such devices is built up frighteningly easily which may have a damaging effect on mental health and encourage a sedentary lifestyle. For example, recent scientific research by the UK government demonstrated that 90% of people in their 30s spend over 20 hours per week on Messenger and similar applications to chat with their friends instead of meeting up and spending quality time together or doing sport. As a result, it is conclusively clear that these technology advancements have decreased and diminished our real life interactions.

On the other hand, although there are significant downsides to technological developments, its’ multifold advantages cannot be denied. This is largely because the popularity of technology such as cellphones allows people to connect freely and easily with no geographical barriers. People are able to share any type of news, information, photos and opinions with their loved ones whenever and wherever they want therefore keeping a feeling of proximity and closeness. For example, an extensive study by Oxford University illustrated that people who work, or study abroad and use applications like Facetime and WhatsApp to chat with their families, are less likely to experience loneliness and feel out of the loop than those who do not. Consistent with this line of thinking is that businessmen are also undoubtedly able to benefit from these advances by holding virtual real -time meetings using Skype which may increase the chance of closing business deals without the need to fly.

From the arguments and examples given I firmly believe that overall communication and mans’ sociability has been advanced enormously due to huge the huge technological progress of the past twenty years and despite some potentially serious health implications which governments should not fail to address, it is predicted that its popularity will continue to flourish in the future.

"The presence of technology in the classroom has become more and more apparent and offers students tremendous resources with which to supplement their education. Given time, technology will completely replace the traditional teacher in the classroom. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?","Technology has been increasingly used throughout the world. This is very apparent in classrooms today. It is disagreed that technology will replace teachers in the classroom. This will be proven by analysing how teachers can cater to the needs of their students as well as motivate and discipline them.

A very important aspect of teaching is the ability of the teacher to shape their teaching style to the needs of their students, as an example, if students in any given class are having trouble understanding a classroom topic, the teacher can rephrase the topic and deliver it in a more effective way, a computerized teacher would be less in-tune with what students require and thus would be incapable of doing this, as a result, technology will not replace teachers.

Motivation and discipline are key to a student`s academic success in the classroom. This is very apparent when teaching children as children require more motivation and discipline to be taught effectively, a technology-based teacher simply cannot accomplish this as certain situations require judgement as to whether a student is acting in an inappropriate manner. After analysing this, it is clear that teachers will always be needed in the classroom.

Following the analyzation of a teacher`s ability to cater to students as well as their capability of guiding students toward success, it is clear that technology will never replace teachers in the classroom. Further, it is expected that technology will act as a supplement to teachers and aid them in instructing their pupils.",No,No,No,No,No,No,5.5
Some people think that new technology always improves the lives of workers Other people believe that it results in disadvantages for workers,"Varying views are on board regarding the impact of technology on the lives of employees. One faction of the society welcomed the changes brought by technology since modern technology has made the workers’ life comfortable and enjoyable. On the other hand, there are some people who argue against this contention. This essay, however, supports the former view and presents its arguments in the ensuing paragraphs.

First and foremost, it is an accredited fact that modern technology has bestowed a plethora of benefits upon workers. Primarily, telecommunication has enhanced the quality of life, as employees these days are leading a quite easy and relaxing life. For example, in the present scenario, employees can work from their home without any need to pay a visit at their office. Adding to this, this new change in work culture also resulted in an escalation of quality of work. Therefore, it is a win-win situation for both the employees and employers.

From a social point of view, the new work from home culture has let the employees to spend valuable time with their family members. To cite an example, the time saved from commuting between office and home would be devoted to family members. Furthermore, employees can also lend a helping hand to their counterparts in the household chores. Therefore, it is rational to state that new innovations have made the life of a working class quite amusing and comfortable.

However, the picture is not so rosy. Some people argue that this recent paradigm shift in work culture has more drawbacks than advantages. This view is born out of the fact that with the advent of computer and the Internet, employees are leading a more hectic and competitive life. Moreover, human is a social animal and social interaction with his peers is an integral part of his life. Unfortunately, this technology has dramatically dwindled the social interaction in other people. However, this is a short-sighted view.

After close scrutiny of the various aspects of the subject in question, it can be concluded that as every coin has two faces, similarly technology has both advantages and disadvantages to the workers. But, it can be safely stated that merits of advanced technological equipments used in industry easily outweigh its demerits to a great extent. ",No,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5
"It said that the fast pace of our everyday life, as a direct result of the rapid development of telecommunication technology and the travel industry, has negative effects on individuals, nations, and the globe. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In today's world, the rapid pace of innovation in technology, communications, and travel, has led to dramatic changes in life and made it a fast life. Although these changes make life better in many ways, many, including me, believe that their disadvantages cannot be easily ignored.

The negative impacts of the fast-paced life resulting from the advancement of technology in both people’s interactions and movement, which is moving at an incredible speed, could be portrayed in three different scales; personal, national, and global. On a personal level, first of all, it is a fact that most people are under intense pressure and a lot of mental stress because they have to put tremendous effort into adapting themselves to this speed. Designers, for example, are faced with new gadgets and architectural applications that are introduced one after the other, creating a new challenge for them because they have to be up to date to get or keep their job. At the second scale (communities), it is obvious that family relationships are compromised because of the limited time that their members have to spend together and is accelerated by establishing virtual connections through social media such as Facebook or WhatsApp so many people may experience failed marriage, which is undoubtedly a problem for communities. On a universal scale, there is a myriad of technology-driven flights that not only does contribute to global warming but also increasing noise pollution. Every day, large amounts of carbon dioxide and other gases are being emitted into the atmosphere, which has a major impact on the climate system. Also, those who are close to airports are very affected by noise, they may face some problems such as sleep disorders.

Admittedly, it is true that advances in technology have made it more convenient for us to travel or communicate than ever before. For example, we can be in contact with a friend or family member via a state-of-the-art device even in out-of-the-way areas or be on the move to visit another part of the world. However, this cutting-edge technology has brought with it a whole new set of problems.

In conclusion, it appears that the satisfaction of a modern lifestyle, new experiences through the acquisition of advanced devices should not make us forget the side effects of these changes. We need to grasp the magnitude of the unfavorable effect in order to find effective solutions.",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6
Some old people today struggle with the use of modern technologies such as smartphones and computers. What is the cause of this? What are some possible solutions?,"As the 21st century continues to unfold, an array of new technologies have arisen, most of which were previously out of the reach of people's comprehension. Computers and cell-phones are patently obvious examples that may cause some elderlies to experience difficulties while using them. Although there are specific root causes related to this problem, effective policies can be adopted to remedy the situation.

There are two main reasons why the old more than others, struggle with keeping abreast of these state-of-the-art gadgets. First and foremost, people over the age of 50 or 60 are "" technology immigrants"". To illustrate, these days, children are born into a fast-changing technological world; they understand even from early ages how to work with these devices; therefore, they called ""technology native"". However, aged people have to acquire the knowledge and skill of using them, exactly like taking in a foreign language. Furthermore, they usually fail to receive sufficient instructions for use from people around, so it is easily perceivable why they prefer to live in an old-fashioned way.

There are, however, some workable solutions to help the senescent how to cope with contemporary society. One step would be education; by planning training schemes, the older adults can be exposed to the technology, so as to learning the skill would be more convenient. By means of these educational courses, which could be a simple video clip, they can determine how user-friendly and effective these gadgets are. Another alternative could be designing specific applications and programs suited to elderlies in order to motivate them.

"In the past, most people used to travel to their place of work. With increased use of computers, the internet and smart phones, more and more people are starting to work from home. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this development?","With the invention of the internet, our lives are facilitated in ways that were never imagined previously. The inclusion of computers and smartphones in our daily lives has brought many pleasant experiences as well as some problems.

Firstly, computers and smartphones have enabled us to work from home which is very helpful for people who have no one to take care of their children at home. Also, these advancements have provided workers with the opportunity of applying for jobs, in other countries far away from their place of living. Moreover, this globalization has given workers the advantage of flexible working hours without discomfort while sitting in their own homes. For instance, during Covid 19 outbreak worldwide, working from home has been an alternative to abide by the rules of social distancing to avoid virus spread.

The main disadvantage of working from home is the lack of social interaction, which in many cases can affect the psychological well-being of workers. While flexible timings are an advantage but in many circumstances, people find it difficult to meet the deadlines due to several distractions at home. A viral video of a politician constantly interrupted by his son during an interview is a great example to show how the cozy and comfortable environment of the home can turn into a major distraction.

To conclude, I think a peaceful environment with flexible working hours is as important as a social circle to maintain one's mental health.

However, some people argue that these devices only make them more difficult. Does modern technology reduce or increase stress? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. You should write at least 250 words.","It is undeniable that modern technology has brought various kinds of labour-saving devices such as communication tools and dishwashers. Although contemporary generation people lives become easier by using these devices, some elderly individuals think that these devices make their lives more complicated. I believe advanced technology is suitable for young generation people because saves a lot of time as well as it reduces stress.

To begin with, the young generation people are often depending on advanced technology. This is because it saves time and energy; they do not require to put a lot of pressure. For instance, if we use washing machines to wash clothes, they do this work within a few minutes without wasting our energy. As a result, people can get a lot of time for themselves to do leisure activities and spend with their family members.

However, older generation people are not familiar with these electronic devices and they often face difficulties to use them. As they are unfamiliar with this new equipment, this may create a lot of stress for them. Therefore, they would prefer to do things manually. For instance, a survey conducted by the Delhi University found that more than 59% of elderly people refused to use of electronic gadgets such as mobiles and computers.

"Over the years, technology has become easier and more efficient to help incorporate into our everyday lives and that include social interacting.","Over the years, technology has become easier and more efficient to help incorporate into our everyday lives and that include social interacting. Communicating through using modern technologies has become one of the main aspects of everyones lives and thus it is important to foresee how it can impact relationships and if it is a positive and negative, because is technology really important for communicating these days? This essay will try to answer the question and also talk about how relationships has changed due to technology but also how it can be exploited for crimes to be preformed.

Technology has amplified the social interactions an individual can have which in return has pushed many people into relationships whether it being superficial or a very trusting one. Technology has improved the communications between people due to how easy it became to generally talk to people and how easy it is to convey feelings to other individuals. For instance, social media found in many technologies became the most popular platform for socializing with various people and thus allowed relationships to be formed through using the internet. Another good example is that texting overall became the number one form of communication between people due to how easy it is to write one's feelings and emotions especially to people that have social anxiety. Furthermore, technology has been the reason of many new relationships but that does not mean that those formed relationships can be classified as good or as healthy.

With technology being the main source of socializing in the 21st century, there has been an increase of negative impact it had with creating relationships. Technology has become an outlet for people to interact without the need of knowing one's identity and thus it can become quite dangerous especially to young adolescents. To illustrate, there has been many cases of crimes being conducted through interacting with strangers online where people could lie about their identities, and so many crimes such as kidnapping and human trafficking has increased and became easier due to the introduction of technology. So, everyone should be careful on who they are interacting with and what information is being shared.

In the end, technology still is important for communicating and forming relationships due to how easy social interactions became along with how simple people could talk with each other without disclosing personal information. Although it became a stable in our lives, it still has a negative impact where there has been a series of crimes initiated through using technology. ",No,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5
Nowadays many people have access to computers on a wide basis and a large number of children play computer games. What are the negative impacts of children playing computer games and what can be done to minimize the bad effects?,"People use computers more extensively these days than ever before, and it is so widespread in our modern world that even children have access to these devices for playing games or watching videos. This essay discusses the disadvantages of playing digital games on computer devices by youngsters and suggests some measures to reduce such negative effects.

Concerning the adverse impacts of young children playing video games, the most devastating one is the addiction these games create. Millions of dollar are spent to make computer games so that they attract a large number of audience and keep them glued to the computer screens. So they are addictive by design and this obsession hampers children's outdoor activities, studies and even time to socialise and learn important life skills. Many research works suggest that children who spend many hours playing computer games end up performing poorly in schools and avoid social events and outdoor activities. This results in physical and psychological issues including poor eyesight and despair. Moreover, violent games cloud the youngsters' judgement and make their rational thinking unstable. Oftentimes, youngsters who play violent games develop violent behaviours.

To minimise the severity of these negative impacts, parents must monitor what their children are doing, especially on computers. They should not be allowed to play computer games more than a couple of hours each week and parents can actively take part in those games with their children so that it becomes family time. Children's outdoor activities should be taken seriously and parents should take them out whenever possible. Finally, parents can use parental control on the digital contents and games their children watch or play. This would deter children from downloading and playing games that are not suitable for their age.

To conclude, computer games, when played excessively by children, have many detrimental effects. Proper parenting and monitoring seem like the best solution to solve these problems. ",No,No,Yes,No,No,No,5
Some people believe that computers are more a hindrance than a help in today's world. Others feel that they are such indispensable tools that they would not be able to live or work without them. In what ways are computers a hindrance? What is your opinion?,"In a modern world where opinions are greatly magnified by media, the perception on the use of computers remain divided. It is deemed as a hindrance since it has a tendency to diminish the concept of ""hard work, "" as the boomer generation would say. Some of them claim that the entitlement of millennials is due to their lack of experience in harnessing the value of patience. Another is when computers disrupt the market demand of several industries. For example, magazine publishing companies are now shifting from print to the digital age by launching their websites with the aid of social media influencers. In effect, this will lessen the production of paper as factories will eventually cease their operations.

On the other hand, computers are also recognized as indispensable, especially when the pandemic affected every person across the globe this year. A lot of industries shut down, countries had economic recessions, commercial stores and restaurants had to close, and people had to find ways to keep their jobs running by working remotely. From face-to-face meetings, seminars and conferences, a great proportion of the labor force now resorted to webinars, online rendezvous, and regular email exchanges.

In my opinion, the necessity of this technological system has proved itself time and time again, especially in this period of global transition. Is this inevitable, you may ask? Computers play a huge part in our lives as it transformed the way we communicate, do our work, collaborate, and share information. On a personal note, if I don't have a computer, I might not be able to function without it since it has provided me with every convenience that I can access.

On the one hand, the utilization of computers in study is advantageous in some certain aspects. Firstly, whenever we go to a shop, school or college, due to the computer, it is primitive for us to find anything that we are looking for. Likewise, if we have to find a book from an enormous library, because of location saved in computer, we can straightforwardly find it without wasting time. More importantly, it has a wide range of opportunities; such as it works without any tiredness, moreover computers perform any labor in a perfect manner with cleanliness.

On the other hand, demerits of using electronic computers on study are varied. Initially, in recent times, we are utilizing from computers continuously, so it impairs our eyes. It is true we can wear special glasses, however, in this case our eyes would become weaker and water starts coming from our eyes. Apart from this, if we connect the internet on a computer, after that radiation of the internet does harm to us. Additionally, if there any young children near to us they may suffer more, furthermore, it is scientifically proven that radiation effects more on birds and they forget the way due to the radiation and also might pass away.

"MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT MODERN TECHNOLOGY HAS MADE PEOPLE MORE SOCIABLE, WHILE OTHERS THINK THAT IT HAS ISOLATED THEM. DISCUSS BOTH IDEAS","Some people think that recent technological advances have boosted friendships and social bonds. On the contrary, others believe that high tech may lead to social isolation.

To begin with, there are some positive aspects of high technology and their social impact. Socially speaking, one tangible effect may be tied to how social networks have changed people's lives worldwide. In today's world, interaction starts by turning on a smart gadget wherever we are and no matter the time. We can draw the conclusion that this is a collaboration of how technology, science and companies working together have made people's connection easier. What is more, this seems to have given room to some particular activities such as online finances, trading and even online health where technology seems to be playing a colossal impact.

Secondly, many sociologists believe that young generations are turning more socially distant and reluctant, jeopardizing social bonds. That is why for many people there are some drawbacks linked to technology's influence on social relationships.

Recent surveys have shown that most communications are taking place through smart gadgets and this may contribute to some distractions such as secondary advertisements. This information of adds might become more relevant than their own sociability promoting solitary activities.

Do you think technology can make the world better?,"Nowadays, with the rapid development of the technology, it becomes an important part of humans’ life. Some people think that technology has made the world a better place to live, but some people do not agree with this idea. I, however, think that technology has made the world a higher quality place to live because it improves our transportation, it is convenient and it is comfortable.

Firstly, with the modern technology, people can have many kinds of transportations. At the past, people had to go by bicycle or on foot; it is really difficult for people to move far away. So in the early 19 century, people with some technology had made the first motorbike to remove that problem. Furthermore, today we have many airplanes, cars, ships, vessels to help us to travel easily.

Secondly, technology is extremely convenient for people, especially for many people who live far from their family. For example, my uncle has lived and worked in America for 15 years, but my grandmother and my family are living in Vietnam so that it is very difficult to contact with him face to face. In spite of that, we can contact him through email or telephone calls. Furthermore, it is extremely helpful when you have to face up to an emergency situation. For instance, a few days ago, I need to bring my research for my literature class and I had left if at home. So I was totally worried because it is the deadline of the research. If I did not hand in the paper, I would have gotten a worse score. Then, in this case, I had to call my father to bring it to me. Thus, it is highly convenient for many people.

Finally, I assume that technology is really comfortable. It is the summer in Vietnam now, it is extremely hot. However, sitting in the air-conditioned room, people do not have to suffer from the hot weather anymore.

"Over the last two or three decades, the way that business is done has changed dramatically due to major advances in technology. As a result, a growing number of people are now choosing to work from the comfort of their own home. However, is the development positive, or are there more drawbacks than advantages?","The advancement in technology had made our life more easier in various aspects. In today's world, business can also be done from home as a result, numerous pupil choose to work from their own home. Despite of its positive development there are also some drawbacks of it. In this essay, I will explore both the pros and cons of working from home and try to draw some conclusions.

On the one hand, there are some advantages of working from home such as it helps us to save money, time and it will be easy for disabled people to work from home. Most of the individual have to go their office through vehicle either by bus or bike which may takes a lot of time. Firstly, By working through home it helps them to save their time and even to save money which is spent on transportation expenses. Secondly, For the handicap people who are permanently injured it makes them comfortable to perform their task in their own home. For instance, the disable individual who feel uncomfortable to work in office can perform their task with confident at their home.

On the other hand, I think that there are also several disadvantages such as less communication with staff and not being able to get knowledge from their seniors. If all the staffs work together at office then they will share their ideas and views with each other about the task and they will gain more information and method from one another. Furthermore, By looking at the performance of their senior staffs they can improve their ability to work. So, If the people work from home then they have to rely on their own ideas, they cannot learn from their seniors and they cannot see their friends performance.

To conclude, It seems to me that the drawbacks of working at their own home are more than its advantage as it is more important to learn new ideas and concepts with will automatically helps for future. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6.5

persuading manufacturers and travelers to adopt the new technology of producing and using electric cars would be more effective strategy for improving air quality.,"I agree with the writer's views that persuading manufacturers and travelers to adopt the new technology of producing and using electric cars would be more effective strategy for improving air quality. The application of new production technology that uses clean fuel and the use of electric cars will significantly reduce emissions to the environment. Because clean fuel sources such as wind, solar, hydroelectricity, biology, … have some inherent properties that make them cleaner than conventional gasoline. These fuels emit fewer hydrocarbons, and the hydrocarbons they release are less reactive (slower to ozone formation) and less toxic. Emissions from electricity, natural gas, or alcohol-powered vehicles can be 90% less toxic and more ozone-forming hydrocarbons than emissions from conventional gasoline-powered vehicles. When applying production technology using clean fuel such as using solar panels to generate electricity for production, minimizing the use of petrol-powered machinery and equipment will promote the reduction of emissions from the factories. As for electric cars, they emit almost no CO2 when we drive them, thereby helping to reduce CO2 emissions, smoke, and dust into the air, resulting in improved air quality and protecting human health. Thus, the application of clean fuel technology to the production and use of electric vehicles will contribute to improving the quality of the atmosphere, while reducing the greenhouse effect and the phenomenon of the Earth's gradual warming.

"Many people worry that the younger generation are becoming increasingly dependent on modern technology, which is replacing real social relationships. Others, however, claim that new technology benefits communication in numerous ways. Which side of this argument do you agree with, and why?","Can we live in today’s world without social media? The answer is no. Social media is everywhere. It has evolved through the decades, and it is here to stay. But how does it really effect the younger generation?

Due to the spread of technology, people have lost the art of communication, and conversation and also makes them ignore language skills and techniques. In addition, probably the section that suffers the most is close relationships. Related people don’t get to see each other and that may have a huge impact on their bond. But to be fair, social media also had many positive and helpful features. It contains the news, information on whatever you ask for, innovative ideas, also something very important, it can help people overcome their social anxieties by giving them information and it also gives you solutions to any hypothetical problems.

It seems that we should reconsider our choices when it comes to social media, not stop using it, but use it with the right way because it’s just us against something we created. I think we can make it. Don’t you agree? ",No,No,No,No,No,No,5.5
In the era of computers what are the benefits and drawbacks of the internet.,"The Internet is gaining popularity in the era of cutting-edge technology. Whether this trend exerts negative impacts on global development remains a matter of dispute. While I understand the rationales of advocates, I still believe the positive aspects are of greater benefit.

On the one hand, it’s undeniable that human have started leading an unhealthy lifestyle since the invention of the Internet. Due to the fact that everything is available online and all we have to do is to sit and search, a dependent, stagnant and sluggish way of living begin to spring up. As a consequence, a growing number of individuals’ curiosity and determination to experience and track down new things die out. Recently, there has been various research pointing out that the percentage of people diagnosed with both mental and physical problems owing to overusing online services rises annually.

On the other hand, undoubtedly, the Internet give a rise to boosting and diversifying the process of approaching knowledge. Internet is an open basement where people can freely upload their understanding therefore, citizens from all over the world are able to gain on latest information. In another words, everything is at our fingertips. Besides, an advanced form of educating developed based on Internet’s facilities is online studying helping millions of juveniles to school from home upon the unforeseen development of Covid-19. As a telling example, I spent more than one and half a year absorbing academic lesion online, still I am capable of graduating on time.

Given pros and cons, everything has upsides and downsides, the Internet is no exception. It is my conviction that it’s straightforward to say that its good points outweigh the bad one. Yet, we need to thoroughly see through both sides to efficiently use this tool.",Yes,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5
"Many people propose that a bunch of technology available is the factor to increase the gap between wealthy and poor people. Meanwhile, others think that technology can have the opposite impact","Many people propose that a bunch of technology available is the factor to increase the gap between wealthy and poor people. Meanwhile, others think that technology can have the opposite impact. While the former idea true to a certain extent, I would argue that some aspects of this idea are not quite right and I support the latter view instead.

On the one hand, it is understandable why some people believe that the gap between rich people and poor people can be increased by range of technology available. In the modern area, some people use luxury smartphones, deluxe laptops as some types of jewelry and others who do not have these luxury gadgets will be isolated from the wealthy. For example, in viet Nam, a lot of young people who have a bunch of modern iphones, Ipads or other modern gadgets can be more adorable than others who do not have these things. Therefore, these luxury items might be the reason for the increase of the distance between rich people and poorer people.

On the other hand, the reason why I side with the idea about technology can be used to decrease the gap between some kinds of people is the development of social media platforms. Social internet is the way to help people from eveywhere in the world to be more closer. An illustration of this is that there are several applications such as Facebook, Tik Tok where people can find it easy to express their ideas, their feelings and they can share their stories with others on these platforms. By using social internet, people do not need to care about the money and gap between types of people in the real life so this gap can be decreased by using social media.

In conclusion, while some people think that technology can be used to increase the gap between rich people and poor people, I believe some aspects of this opinion are not make sense, and I endorse the idea that technology can help people to be more closer instead. ",Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6.5
Is technology limiting creativity?,"We live in a world of fast technology development; therefore, it is not surprising when people start relying on technologists more and more often. People argue that technology’s creativity score is limiting our ability to think and process answers, new ideas and inventions. We search for something when we need it but nowadays, we rely on internet or other developed technologies and there are very few of us who really want to develop something new. We are so much stuck to our day to day activities that we never try something new. Technology has played a significant role in entertainment and it is taking away our ability to find new ways to entertain ourselves. We are getting used to technology and it can badly affect our health and mind. It is limiting our artistic skills and creative skills and we don't realize that creativity is a life skill.

In today’s world technology plays a big role in our lives, we use it for work school and just everyday activities. People always want to use the technology and don’t do any kind of work by themselves. People stop thinking about ideas, new inventions, and innovations. If people face some kinds of problems, they just use phone and computer and search on the Google search engine and they try to find the answers and solutions as fast and efficient as possible. Life is very easy because of modern technological devices, gadgets, and machines. It makes our working easy, faster, and effective. Modern technology is indeed very helpful for us in working. But the problem is we just reuse the technology for our work. We are slowly forgetting how to do work creatively and more effectively. We completely rely on technology. We didn’t think and use our minds for working more creatively. We just want to do our work as fast as we can do it. Technology is killing our creativity and thinking power.

In a world where technology delivers so many advantages, it can be difficult to look squarely at its liabilities. Entertainment is just another form of Technology and it is important as it brings people together and is a good way for the entire family bond. Entertainment and computer games has a good side and it can bring joy and happiness. However, entertainment also has negative effects, people constantly want to stay entertained and are stuck in the amusing digital world and this distracts people to think and process new ideas and inventions; therefore, creativity-one of the most essential human traits, not to mention one of the most valuable skills as creative things is diminished or lost altogether. Instead of going and playing and having fun on the outside web we rather are stuck right here and sacrificing original thought for keeping ourselves constantly entertained.

There are plenty of benefits from technology. Technology has helped us in the medical fields that helps diagnosing and curing people. It has also helped people discover new diseases technology and has also helped them with communications through which now we are able to send text messages, e-mails, eFax and even make phone calls. However, now we are getting used to it and are depending on it. We don’t even use our brain because technology has made us lazy and we cannot imagine a single day without it. We are so much stuck to our smartphones that, we can’t think of anything without it. Therefore, technological devices are being overused and this has a negative impact on an individual because it can badly affect their health and mind and also distorts social interactions.

Technology is very helpful in our lives especially when we are in our future business world, we can make our work easier and faster but it makes our mind lazy as well as less creative because we depend on technology. Creativity has been shown to decline as technology becomes more of a part of our lives because we don't even use our brain for our originality. If you’re dependent on technology for your imagination, thinking, and ideas your creativity will surely be dimmed. Too much usage of technology for entertainment purpose also affects the creativity and in result, it limits our artistic skills and creative skills. We must always bear in mind that enhancing creativity is something that comes from within us not something that comes from that technology. ",No,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5

Write an essay of 250 words on the following topic: What are the advantages and disadvantages of using technology in modern society?,"It is increasingly clear that technology has made human life become easier and more convenient than in the past. However, it also has both pros and cons which I am going to discuss in the paragraph below.

Beginning with the positive points, the arrival of technology has redefined the way people interact with each other. In today's society, communication technology has made it exceedingly simple for people to connect with others all over the world. For example, in the past, people could only contact by sending letters; now, anyone can communicate with anyone else anywhere in the globe simply by using a smartphone. Furthermore, employing technology can boost staff work productivity. People may do their jobs faster and more flexibly even in the toughest circumstances, such as social distancing caused by Covid-19.

On the other hand, if technology is abused, it will cause some drawbacks. First and foremost, humans will grow increasingly reliant on technology, and certain jobs may be automated in the future. Instead of hiring humans, corporations might save money by purchasing equipment to assist them in their job, which may lead to unemployment status. Furthermore, individuals may lose touch with reality and become immersed in the technological world. Indeed, many people prefer to spend more time on their phones, watching TV, or playing video games than they do with their friends or family. It may cause communication between people to be disrupted, as well as isolated.

To conclude, technology has undeniable advantages that make life simpler. People might broaden their contacts and operate more effectively thanks to advances. However, there are some downsides that must be acknowledged and avoided as soon as possible. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6.5
the role of technology is becoming more and more important,"The world is changing. Since we are living today in an electronic information age, the role of technology is becoming more and more important. In one side, it is easier to be connected by technology. However, disadvantages still appeared. That's why we have to carefully consider its benefits and drawbacks.

There is no doubt that high-tech brings us countless of advantages. For instance, network has enabled people to access to the worldwide web so that they can search for priceless information from numerous fields from all over the world. Furthermore, we can use internet to communicate with relatives and friends who live faraway much easier, with no cost. In addition, for the elderly, television is a great source of both entertainment and information with weather forecast, musical programs, movies and news. Information age has created an easier lifestyle, and nobody can deny it.

Nevertheless, the high-tech devices has surely opened the door to another world but those amusing tools are extremely easy to addicted too. Naturally, TV is designated in the first place to help people relax and refresh their mind so the majority of its content is entertaining with the goal to keep you watching. It goes the same with social network and internet. The more time you spend to ""entertain"", the more time you lost. Moreover, once somebody get addicted, he can't spend enough time for his social circle, which lengthen the gap between people.

In conclusion, although technology help entertain and gets things easier, it does not mean that all people are happy. I strongly believe that information age and technology create opportunities, but only opportunities, and nothing more. In brief, it's people who make their choice on what benefit them and what not.

"Nowadays, almost everything in the world have affected due to technology,","Nowadays, almost everything in the world have affected due to technology, communication among people experiences these changes specifically. Hence, interaction among people are occurred differently and technology takes people's hand in this sort of tasks but all of commentaries about technology are not positive alone.

At the first glance, the pace of communication is the great change engaging with technology. For example, in the past, people conversation and meeting widely limited to the time that they were gather in the same place, while in the recent decades, individuals could easily interact with each other just if they have a mobile phone. In addition, owing to high-tech devices both people's networks and their acquaintances have spread dramatically. Hence, there are countless relations which their sides are not in the same city, country and even a continent. Furthermore, not only does affected education system, but also most of the occupations have changed widely and become better. For instance, todays, nobody would not surprise owing to online learning or teleworking.

On the other hand, despite a tremendous number of technology's advantages there are several disadvantages. For example, when people interact with each other through online means just a simple profile picture has been seen, so the possibility of identity theft increase. Also, addiction to using technological gadgets is another big negative point about this phenomenon. A good case to mention is online education during pandemic of COVID-19. In this period pupils had to use cell-phones, tablets and lab tops for accomplish their education tasks, as the result, they have been accustomed to using this sort of devices instead of being active in physical activity.

But where do we start?,"In this time of advanced technology it is hard to say that this world is old-fashioned. But is caring for our environment is old-fashioned? It seems that every country in the world has with pollution. I think that these problems can be fixed. But where do we start?

We begin with transport. Emissions from cars greatly damage the environment and the fact that almost every citizen has one doesn’t make it any better. A good solution to that would be to motivate people to use electric cars. The second place to check would be rivers and seas. Anything from sunken transport to waste thrown out by people should be cleaned since it creates trouble both for animals and us. The third problem would be littering. Why? Because a lot of packaging used and thrown away is not biodegradable. Keeping the package on your person and throwing it away at the bin should do the trick.

In conclusion, I have shown you that we have a lot of problems with taking care of environment, but we have the solutions to them. All we need is just enough time and effort.

Part 2. 3

Throughout our lives we learn many things and obtain many characteristics. Some are good, some are bad. It’s really hard to say which one is the most useful. But I would say that the most useful thing I have ever learned is the ability to look at life a little more easier and find balance in things you do on every day basis.

You can’t expect great work if you don’t have a great rest. These things are pretty proportional, in my opinion. Not only that, living in constant stress and work won’t do you a lot of good, so a rest that can take care of all that before the next time you sit to do something tedious should be helpful. But don’t let that rest take all of your time or else you’ll fall behind. Plan your time ahead, balance your rest and work so that you won’t be consumed by them. Doesn’t that sound great?

In the end, not everyone will agree with me, but that’s ok. That’s my opinion and I agree with myself. I just wanted to share that thought with anyone reading this.",No,No,No,No,No,No,5.5
"Taking everything into consideration, I would say that violence in contemporary media has no substantial influence on people's behavior. Television and computers are not the main factors that shape personal character, and they can even be useful in reducing the level of violence.","These days, the amount of violence in media is growing. While some people argue that this trend will undoubtedly lead humans to dangerous future, others claim that it has no damaging effect on the society. I believe that in most cases media violence doesn't affect people's behavior.

Firstly, I think that people act from their motives, regardless what they see on the television. That is to say, if someone intends to do harm to somebody, that is not because of watching TV or playing computer games, but due to that person's character and education. Although it is generally considered that violent media accustoms viewers to cruelty, I doubt this opinion. In my view, reasonable and intelligent people treat others humanely irrespective of what they see or hear in fictional stories.

Moreover, video games and television may even reduce social violence by providing a safe outlet for aggressiveness. In other words, truculent people may fight in virtual reality instead of evincing their combative spirit in real world. This may not only help those people, but also reduce the level of social violence in long-term perspective.

Finally, despite many claims and assumptions about negative effects of television and computer games I have never seen any proven connection between violent media and illegal activities in social life.

Taking everything into consideration, I would say that violence in contemporary media has no substantial influence on people's behavior. Television and computers are not the main factors that shape personal character, and they can even be useful in reducing the level of violence.

causes and solution of children spend time playing computer games,"It is undeniable that children who spend time playing computer are growing constantly. There are several causes of this alarming trend, but measures could certainly be taken to tackle the problem. In my opinion, the foremost cause of addiction in video games is helping children release pressure and high tension. Due to the fact that computer games could bestow players more jubilant as well as ecstatic because these games are transported into the virtual world which is often more exciting and engaging than real-life pastimes. Furthermore, this matter can be attributed to the lack of parental supervision. By dint of parents are busy with hustle and bustle life to earn for living so that the inadequacy of care for offspring is made. Therefore, instead of sending their children to the park for outside activities, parents choose to keep them at home to play video games, which increases the amount of time spent in front of a screen by young people. There are several actions that could be taken to solve the problems. First, to solve these issues, parents must take responsibility. It means that they must filter the games that youngsters often play, removing some of the harmful games and replacing them with educational games. Give youngsters activities to help them strengthen their skills and expand their capacity to be creative. A second measure should be to create more green space for outdoor activities. In particular that, the government ought to use the national budget to invest money in sports facilities along with playgrounds so that kids will have more choice of entertainment. In conclusion, the young generation is spending most of their time playing virtual games needs to be considered as an urgent task in the 21st century to ensure a better life for the next generation.

Some people think computer is very important for personal use.but some believe it has harmful impact on persons,"Experts throughout both the developing and developed world have debated whether the advent of sophisticated modern technology such as mobile phones, laptops and iPad have helped to enhance and improve people's social lives or whether the opposite has become the case.

Personally, I strongly advocate the former view. This essay will discuss both sides using examples from the UK government and Oxford University to demonstrate points and prove arguments.

On the one hand there is ample, powerful, almost daily evidence that such technology can be detrimental especially to the younger generation who are more easily affected by it’s addictive nature and which can result in people feeling more isolated from the society.

The central reason behind this is twofold, firstly, the invention of online social media sites and apps, such as Twitter and Facebook have reduced crucial face-to-face interactions dramatically. Through use of these appealing and attractive mediums, people feel in touch and connected yet lack key social skills and the ability to communicate.

Secondly, dependence on such devices is built up frighteningly easily which may have a damaging effect on mental health and encourage a sedentary lifestyle. For example, recent scientific research by the UK government demonstrated that 90% of people in their 30s spend over 20 hours per week on Messenger and similar applications to chat with their friends instead of meeting up and spending quality time together or doing sport. As a result, it is conclusively clear that these technology advancements have decreased and diminished our real life interactions.

On the other hand, although there are significant downsides to technological developments, its’ multifold advantages cannot be denied. This is largely because the popularity of technology such as cellphones allows people to connect freely and easily with no geographical barriers.

People are able to share any type of news, information, photos and opinions with their loved ones whenever and wherever they want therefore keeping a feeling of proximity and closeness. For example, an extensive study by Oxford University illustrated that people who work, or study abroad and use applications like Facetime and WhatsApp to chat with their families, are less likely to experience loneliness and feel out of the loop than those who do not.

Consistent with this line of thinking is that businessmen are also undoubtedly able to benefit from these advances by holding virtual real -time meetings using Skype which may increase the chance of closing business deals without the need to fly.

From the arguments and examples given I firmly believe that overall communication and mans’ sociability has been advanced enormously due to huge the huge technological progress of the past twenty years and despite some potentially serious health implications which governments should not fail to address, it is predicted that its popularity will continue to flourish in the future.

Multinational organizations have entered the world market. This has caused a number of problems for small local businesses. What are some of the problems and what solutions can you suggest?,"Currently cosmopolitan organizations started performing in the world market. numerous small local startups have been triggered by such occasion. the essay below will highlight the causes and solutions for that.

A giant problem local businesses encounter with is the inability to compete large, international businesses. although there are still chances for small corporations to thrive, they are diminished to minimum, as large organizations attract most of the target audience. This could be due to the smaller budget local businesses have, which might hinder them from investing into the improvement of their products.

The second problem is large businesses not being able to shape the local community, whereas local businesses are. Building a sense of community is essential for a business to prosper and local businesses cope with this task better, as they are more aware of local needs and demand for specific products or services.

Last but not least, the burden of high taxation makes it difficult for small businesses to survive, therefore leaving only international businesses in the world market. local businesses might not have enough income to pay the taxes, as their clients have been gained over by their larger competitors.

Although there are numerous issues caused by large organizations to local businesses, there are a few solutions which could be done in order to improve the current situation. First of all, local businesses should be subsidized by the government for them in order to compete with larger businesses. the foundation could play a key role in the producement of products that could attract local customers. the next solution would be big companies working alongside local businesses to support the community. Knowing the local community inside out will benefit the customers and local businesses equally. The last solution to support local organizations is granting global corporations further tax cuts. This will make it easier and cheaper for small businesses to thrive.

All things considered, even though there are certain major problems local businesses face, by implementing these solutions this problem will be solved. ",No,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5
"Even though Globalization affects the world’s economics in a very positive way, its negative sides should not be forgotten. Discuss","Everything has tow sides in the world, and so has the prosses of globalization too. The effects of globalization on the world economy are diverted.

We must acknowledge that the negative effects are from a different kind than the positive ones. Therfor the negative sides, like low paiment in less developed countries are important to conciderate.

If we take the Eurozone for example, the economic changes according to the gloablisation process are huge. Many companies have transferred their factories into cheaper production earies to compeat in the world markes. The results are rising unemployment rates in the “old industrial countries”.

In regard to the other countries on the world market, such as China, this job transfer is a big opportunity. But no one can denie that the consequences for the less developed countries where economy flourished, based on availability of cheap employees are highly important: globalization based on this facts brings enviromantal problems.

Nevertheless, there are also posive reasons for globlaistaional effects. In general it is remarkable that there is a new tendency in “Thinking Global”. For instance, people are willing to leran more languages and get educated about othe cultures. Countries fromaly knowen as undeveloped, such as India, are getting chances to be the main leader in a certain field.

All in all it can be said that the effects of globalization are enormous. The unerstanding of economic processes has changed completely. It is important to think in bigger terms, not just about the owencountry. The positive things that this globalization process have brought must sensible us for the negative sides.

"Even though globalisation has brought benefit to many countries , it's negative side should not be forgotten . To what extent do you agree?","Whether the export and import in all over the country is beneficial to us on every side or not has become the matter of discussion. I agree with this that there are some negative consequences are also included in this in the process of globalisation that will be clarified below.

To begin with, the export and import that takes place in every country makes and rise the standard of living of every individual. To elaborate, people get an opportunity to meet with all products that are manufactured even in other nation. Moreover, they use these products in their daily lives rather than using those old products those have less productive in this contemporary era. Due to meet with new products these makes the lives of people comfortable and convenient.

In addition, globalisation reduce the reputation of companies those are doing their business in their own country. To substantiate, globalisation leads to that multinational companies take place in other nations and start their business that give negative impact to that nation. In spite of their own organisation those produce products hundreds of years ago, people of that country like to visit in these multinational companies as they believe that these companies sell them high branded products to them.

To conclude, it can be concluded that globalisation brings advantages to people by making their standard of living high whereas it gives negative impact also like multinational companies take place that forced the other organisations in loosing their productivity. ",Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6
"most countries, multinational companies and their products are becoming more and more important. This trend is seriously damaging our quality of life.","In this fast moving world we all are surrounded by multinational companies and their products. These company and good are beneficial for us following statement will justify my opinion.

Daily new products are coming in market which making are life easy in both the ways professional and personal. This multinational companies provide good quality products along with a proper packaging which prevents products from damages.

Secondly, increasing of these companies is directly proportional with the rate of employment. We are all aware of the fact that being a white collar worker demands for higher education which is next to impossible because of higher amount of fees it required which is difficult for every individual to pay.

These companies are giving opportunities for individual as a source of income. As a result, this will automatically decrease poverty rate in country.

Thirdly, people before purchasing a good is more concerned with the authenticity and quality of the product. These multinational companies have high reputation in the form of authenticity and quality so, that is why people are more involving in multinational companies.

What are the advantages and disadvantages of this.,"In some developing nations, multinational firms are becoming increasingly prevalent. The main advantage is that people will get many options, and they can buy some products which might not available in some countries. The main drawback is that it may provides detriment impact on the economic growth of the developing nations.

In some developing nations, so as to produce or cultivate certain fruits, vegetables, and other commodity products. These products require an adequate temperature, land and high technique for manufacturing. Which might not available in some developing countries. Multinational companies can play a vital role to fullfill the demands of some products. These multinational companies might have to deposit certain amount to stay or for expand. Which would better for the countries' economy. For instance, Zara company, which is clothes foreign company, has now become a multinational company. Since its branches are available on all around the world, many people are taking this advantage by paying the fair prices. Before this they were paying extra charges for shipping.

However, some time, some multinational companies provide extra discounts to attract customers that may affects to the local economy. For instance, one study found that McDonald, which is a fast food chain, has the lowest price as well as good quality food. Because Its chain located in many countries. Since then, many local restaurants and cafes have closed in some developing countries.

In conclusion, although multinational firms have strength to fullfill the requirements of the public, it may also exacerbate to the economy situation of the developing countries.",No,No,Yes,No,No,No,5.5
There is no doubt that because of globalization and advancements in technology we can communicate better with people in different parts of the world.,"There is no doubt that because of globalization and advancements in technology we can communicate better with people in different parts of the world. Nowadays, social networks, such as Facebook and Instagam, have a significant role in our lives as they are part of the routine of the majority of people in almost all societies. Although there are disadvantages of having these networking, the benefits of using these apps outweigh the negatives. It is my firm belief that these sites and apps contribute positively to people's life. I feel this way for several reasons which I will explain in the following paragraphs.

To begin with, globalization makes people more connected and it decreases physical barriers. For these reasons, it is indispensable that we can easily communicate with people from different countries. My experience has taught me that social media is the best way of achieving this. In 2010, I traveled around Asia and I made friends. Unfortunately, it was really difficult to sustain a relationship with the local people after returning home. At that time the only way of connecting with them was by phone. It was not practical and it was expensive, so I lost contact with all the people that I met. Some years later, I traveled around South America and I also met many people. However, this time I could build a long term relationship with them because of social media. My new friends and I became friends on Facebook and when I was back home I was easily sending them photos and messages. I think that it is incredible and necessary to have this kind of contact and the best way of doing this is by social media.

Moreover, I definitely think that as a society is really important to be connected to people from different parts of the world. This way we are more informed about what is happening around us and we can think not only at the local level, but also in the world as one. My father said that before social media, he was immersed just in the local culture. After creating an account on Facebook, he started to follow international leaders that were sharing information about how to make better decisions. After getting their tips, my father started to apply this advice in his routine. After a while, many people around him also did it, and most of the people in his town have a new behavior which impacted positively to their lives.

To conclude, I strongly believe that if you are not using social media, you are losing the opportunity to build strong relationships with people that are far from you, and you're totally limited to information in the area that you live. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,5
It has been said that the world is becoming a global village in which there are no boundaries to trade and communication. Do the benefits of globalisation outweigh the drawbacks?,"Especially after the mid-nineteen century, with technological development and increase transportation line world has become a global structure and relation limits have disappeared on a lot of areas. While this new world form has some drawbacks, from the point of my view the benefits of globalization outweigh its negative effects in terms of different sides.

Globalization includes various benefits about trade, technological, economic and social for people and countries. With technological development and transportation line, all the people who live in the world can learn and reach new products and services at the same time. Thus, the class, cultural and living differences may reduce between people and societies. Besides, countries and governments can increase trade agreements with other diverse countries and organizations, and in this way, their economical structures can develop. Furthermore, investments which have been made in undeveloped countries have risen which cause to up employ level. Study research which has been conducted by the United Nations shows that percentage of prosperity in undeveloped countries has doubled with globalization.

On the other hand, adapting to the globalization world requires significant infrastructure investments which can be harmful for environmental systems. Increasing industrialization and transportation have brought about the overuse of national resources which trigger climate change and global warming. Moreover, undeveloped and developing countries offer cheap labor to investors which can reduce salary and losing jobs in different countries. Additionally, lack of boundaries gives rise to immigration which causes sociological problems.

In conclusion, even if globalization has some undesirable effects and results, it is clear that it has numerous benefits for humanity. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6
"There is no doubt that globalisation has benefited the world by bringing together people, business and nations. People who criticise it stand in the way of progress. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Undoubtedly, the term globalization has many advantages such as uniting people of the world, business and countries. Critics who resist this blocking its development. I strongly agree with the statement. Few people who are against globalization deliberately stopping a huge benefits and advancements that provides.

First of all, most of the individuals who protest against the act of bringing together world nations are not real social activists. They are such people who are just against the governments that rule them for example opposing parties in the nation. In order to oppose every bills and acts provided by a particular politician they try to stop the beneficial progress such as globalization without even knowing the actual uses of it.

Another set of people who are opposing the trade between countries are local vendors. For instance, farmers of the nations are afraid about their own productions which might become invaluable. Because some multinational companies try to sell their products at low costs which will greatly affect the native growers. I partly agree with them, however governments of such nations are taking necessary actions to protect their local sellers. We must make sure that people are aware of such actions taken by the authorities so that they will understand the ongoing development by globalisation.

To conclude, globalisation is an developing advancement which will bring people of different countries and cultures together. This thereby assist in making lives of citizens of each and every nation better and provide peace all over the globe. Criticizers must make way for such good method. Thus the future generations will enjoy lots of benefits by trading between world countries.",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6
"Even though globalization affects the World's economy in a positive way, its negative side should not be forgotten. Discuss.","We all are living in a technological era and the entire earth has been becoming a small town day by day. For these all kinds of changes only globalization is responsible. It makes the whole world small. Owing to this, globalization has been in the whole world. It brings a wide range of fruitful effects for each and every person. Nevertheless, as we all know, vis a vis a coin' s 3 sides, there are myriad demerits of globalization, that we should not be ignored. Here, I am going to discuss both views concerning merits and its demerits.

At the beginning, globalization is a great favor of technology for human beings. It makes daily routine life so easy and comfortable. Wide range of benefits are heeded by folks: travelling is getting so easy, Edification amenities are available, goods transportation amenities are available in the entire world and the most important amenity is travelling and the tourism industry is surging swiftly. For instance, from some last decades the travelling and tourism has been proliferating with ample amenities for flitting to another nation within limited time duration with high levels of comfort. In India from last 1o years tourism and travelling industry is playing a vital role in GDP of the nation. Owing to this it contributes 12. 4 percent in growth in GDP.

On other hand, negative impacts of this globalization can not be ignored. There are myriad chances of leakage of secret information via internet service in the world. It can create a hazardous situation for national security. Moreover, sometimes detrimental ailments can be spread all around the world by globalization. For example, Recently in the year 2019, the most horrible pandemic known as covid - 19 was spread by China due to their reckless nature toward world's health. It was done by China, via a goods transportation chain. At the initial level it was found only in The china, but due to irresponsible attitude they didn't consider that virus seriously. And they were perpetually running their trending business with other nations. As a result of that nie days while the world is suffering from that ailment.

All in all, there are lots of merits of globalization for people. But there are also some inimical issues that can be created by it. ",No,No,No,No,No,No,5.5
The best way to understand other cultures is to work for a multinational company. Do you agree or not?,"Multinational companies can be found in most major countries around the world these days. Working for a multinational company is thought by many to be the most effective medium to learn about different cultures. Although working for such a company provides the opportunity to mix with people from a variety of cultural backgrounds, I would argue that this is not necessarily the best way to learn about other cultures. There is no doubt that for some people working for a multinational organisation will enhance their understanding of other cultures. The first reason is that in a multinational organisation one can learn about the customs and traditions of other countries through mixing with people from different backgrounds who work in the company or in liaising with colleagues abroad. Exposure to other languages is also likely, something that gives a much greater depth of understanding of a culture. There may also be the chance to relocate to work in another country, which would mean complete immersion in that culture. However, there are number of reasons that it is not necessarily the best way. Firstly, there is no guarantee that you will be a person who gets such exposure to other cultures as it depends on your position within the company. Not all employees have roles where they regularly mix with other cultures. also, there are other excellent ways to achieve such goal. Many people these days travel the world, and this is an opportunity to meet and spend time with people from other countries. It is also possible to do voluntary work with organisations and charities that work in other countries, something that would mean you meet a mix of people rather than just those who work in companies. I conclusion, despite the potential ways in which working for a multinational company can result in contact with people from other cultures, I believe that it cannot be assumed it is the best way as there are other options to do this.

However, the question is ""Is the growth of multinational corporation number spoil the environment system? Is one of the most cotroversial issues today.

"Nowadays, multinational countries are becoming more common, than they used to be a few decades ago, There are humans from all over the world, who live in cities of this cosmopolitan countries.","Nowadays, multinational countries are becoming more common, than they used to be a few decades ago, There are humans from all over the world, who live in cities of this cosmopolitan countries. Staying in the way of this process, governments should ensure that all these people live with each other in peace. This essay will first consider the main reasons of people migrating around the world and then discuss how governments can be convinced that people live in cities harmoniously.

It is clear that the main causes of migrating are the history of regions and availability of travelling around the world. Some countries have conquered regions of different nations in the past. It led to spreading the languages and customs of these countries and, eventually, it has impacted on current days. For instance, there is a diversity of different nations in Manchester and the priority of the, are nations that were conquered by England in the past.

Multinational cities are becoming a big issue in safety and governments around the world must be ensured that people live in peace. It is said that governments should integrate the languages of the majority nations into official languages of countries to prevent disputes and they also should organize surveys to understand what could be done to protect different nations. For example, there are many official languages in Switzerland that is being taught at school and, moreover, the government always analyses the feedbacks from citizens about this diversity of languages. It leads to understanding by citizens that they are all equal.

Overall, countries are becoming more cosmopolitan these days and it is vital for governments to intervene in the safety of people and ensure that humans live in harmony. ",Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6.5
Globalization is such a commonly used term in the twentieth century.,"Globalization is such a commonly used term in the twentieth century. It simply means that the world has become integrated economically, socially, politically and culturally through the advances of technology, transportation and communication. It is undeniable that globalization has resulted in both positive and negative effects which must be addressed accordingly.

To begin with, globalization has contributed to the world’s economies in many beneficial ways. The advances in science and technology have allowed businesses to easily cross over territorial boundary lines. Consequently, companies tend to become more productive and competitive thereby raising the quality of goods, services and the world’s living standard. Secondly, several companies from the more developed countries have already ventured to establish foreign operations or branches to take advantage of the low cost of labor in the poorer countries. This kind of business activity will provide more influx of cash or investment funds into the less developed countries.

However, one cannot deny the negative effects which have derived from globalization. One crucial social aspect is the risk and danger of epidemic diseases which can easily be spread as the transportation becomes easier and faster in today’s advanced society. This is evidenced in the recent birds flu disease which has infected most Asian countries over a short period of time.

As large corporations invest or take over many offshore businesses, a modern form of colonization will also evolve which may pose certain power pressure on the local governments of the less developed countries. Unemployment rates in the more developed regions such as Europe may also escalate as corporations choose to outsource to the cheaper work force from Asian countries.

In conclusion. I like to reiterate that globalization is inevitable and we must urge individuals, companies and governments to use a more balanced approach by taking the appropriate steps to deal with matters relating to the financial or economical gains verses the social, political or ecological concerns of the world.",Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6
"Even though globalization affects the world's economies in a very positive way, its negative side should not be forgotten. What is your view? Discuss. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Everything has 2 sides and the globalization is not the exception. Our first thoughts about this topic include the process of global“mcdonaldisation” And generally speaking spreading the one American lifestyle across the whole globe

Firstly I would try to concentrate on the positive aspects of globalization. As far as the economy is concerned, institutions like the global bank or IMF are always focused on developing the in apostrophe 3rd world and helping poor people to combat their life obstacles (through loans and donations).

Moreover the world becomes an area of sharing thoughts (Example philosophical or economical doctrines), Which become popular due to lack of barriers.

However, the disadvantages of globalization are also widely known. some people insist that because of this process, the spirit of countries and nations rapidly disappears. The integrity, established houndreds hundreds years ago is on the verge of collapsing. Furthermore, there's a strong lobby of communists who reckon, that the globalization indicates an uncontrolled reign of the impact of global investments on the environment- The greenhouse effect or soar rains are triggered by globalization.

To sum up, globalization has both positive and negative influences on our everyday life. I can’t agree with the popular statement that we should try to avoid being affected by it however we must not forget about our surroundings and local communities they have a great value which should last forever.",No,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5
Small businesses are disappearing and being replaced by large multinational companies. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?,"It is generally claimed that minute companies are vanishing from the world due to a enormous multicultural comporations. This essay will demostrate why is the reduction of the competition beneficial, and also will show why is the diversity of the industries essential. Moreover, I believe advantages of the statement do not outweigh the drawbacks.

First and foremost, having fewer businesses supports others to get money. These days, there are a number of companies selling similar products. Therefore, the reduction of the smallest organisations automatically means more chances for different brands. For instance, apple is known for designing mobile phones. However, on the scene are additional industries creating the same items which means people need to choose from a range of options. Consequently, the decrease of possibilities lead to the higher profit in favour of large business.

On the other hand, great variacy of organisations is vital for the society. It is a fact that every human is different, due to this, needs of a person can vary a lot. Furthermore, in some situations, majority can not find the proper product created in the start up, because it does not exist anymore. For example, my mother wanted to buy a special shirt but she could find the shop. Afterwards, she read that company for replaced by commersianlized business. Lastly, she was angry and really upset.

In conclusion, to do not have the necessity to fight with a result of earning more money is an extreme plus. Athough, the freedome of choice is a part of life that should not be replaced. Accordingly, I am certain that disadvantages have more crucial values than benefits.",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6
Business culture in globalization impact on an international business with operations in different countries.,"Over the last three decades, a fundamental shift has been occurring in the world economy. We are moving toward a world in which barriers to cross-border trade and investment are declining; perceived distance is shrinking due to advances in transportation and telecommunications technology; material culture is starting to look similar the world over, and national economies are merging into an interdependent, integrated global economic system. The process by which this is occurring is commonly referred to as globalization.

Globalization has resulted in greater cross-national business and cultural interactions. This also means the business culture has considerable importance for an international business with operations in different countries. When you’re dealing with people from another culture, you may find that their business practices, communication, and management styles are different from those to which you are accustomed. Understanding the culture of the people with whom you are dealing is important to successful business interactions and to accomplishing business objectives.

Occasionally business culture will affect your ability to enter an international market, develop and maintain business relationships, negotiate successful deals, conduct sales, conduct marketing, advertising campaigns, engage in manufacturing, and distribution.

In conclusion, we need to understand the point of view of people who worry about cultural globalization because it is a threat to national traditions. However, this is outweighed by its positive impact on international understanding and the fact that it represents progress within a society. ",No,No,Yes,No,No,No,5
Globalization a challenge to the concept of nation-state. Write your opinion on it.,"Globalization is nothing but reducing barriers between the nation states for international commerce and communication. It can be sometimes seen as potential threat to nation states as the concept of nation state itself is sovereign government. Transportation became easy between the continents but it did not changed the sovereignty of individual nations. Instead, globalization changed the way nations deal with others. So in my opinion globalization is not a challenge for the concept of nation-state. However it favors westernization. So the countries that are dealing with America and Europe are at disadvantage. MNCs forces nation states to determine how much international influence they allow in their economies. It also creates a sense of interdependence among the nations. It could create an imbalance of power among different nations. ",No,No,No,No,No,No,5.5
"Globalisation has taken place in last few years along with it advantages , some say that it has disadvantages too . At what extent do you agree or disagree ?","Connecting the world together has definitely been advantageous in so many aspects. It is seen that in former years the global union as a whole entity has established itself with countless perks although some people believe along with the benefits it provides, it has it’s own hazards. Forthcoming paragraphs will elaborate how beneficial or harmful it really is.

To commence with the advantages, one can righteously say that there are a lot of them, likes of business and trade, exchanging cultures, health promotion and many more. Firstly, there are many tie ups between nations in field of business, that has been made during past years which made immense progress that a mankind has seen over years. For instance Tata a huge Indian company collaborated with ford from France. Further more there is even more progression in Healthcare ecosystem, one of the best facilities are being exchanged to and forth between multiple cosmopolitans.

One can also not deny the hazards which are there on the cost of so called globalisation. World has seen exuberance of pandemic that nearly took millions of lives worldwide. The globalisation has made humans thrive for success internationally which eventually has brought depression and other mental health problem into the society. One can magnify the fact that globalisation is great when it does not jeopardise.

To conclude, I believe globalisation has definitely benefited the world to a great extent but account of advantages it certainly has some disadvantages too.",No,No,Yes,No,No,No,6
Globalization has many positive effects on the world's economy but the negative effects of it cannot be forgotten. Do you think it is a positive or negative development?,"It is obvious that globalization is a hot topic that has never failed to attract people's attention and provoked controversy. Although this trend certainly has its own drawbacks, I strongly believe the benefits globalization brings are much more prevalent. These advantages and disadvantages will be outlined in this essay.

On the one hand, it seems disadvantageous that globalization threatens cultural identity. This is because under the influence of globalization, the emergence of a lot of cultures and practices in the same nation is inevitable that can make the indigenous cultures homogenize effortlessly. On the other hand, in the worst case, these can be vanished. To cite an example, indeed, for some decades, Vietnam's young generation has integrated cultures and practices from many countries such as Korea, China, the US. . . because of globalization. The youths are tending to pursue international cultures instead of tapping into the ancient tradition. Time after time, the beauty of traditional cultures will be died out( extinguished) because as a consequence young people have not stepped in to take the elderly's place.

Nevertheless, it would be a mistake if we do not appreciate the advantages of globalization. In a term of globalization, a lot of gaps in different practical aspects will be filled through open-door policy such as health care services and local economy. To elaborate, health care services become better and better from technology transfer because of the appearance of many categories of further equipment. Not to mention, in fact, the prosperity of modern transportation allows us to engage in global trade. A recently released report shows that the corporations can import and export merchandise simpler than in the previous period due to the ease of taking into fair trade organization so that many potential nations invest in global trade that raises the domestic economy. The result in, the modernized and industrialized country is not far, and this definition will become the truth for a while.

In conclusion, the benefits of globalization from open-door policy outweigh the drawbacks. For the aforementioned reasons, I believe that the effect of globalization is positive for many countries.",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,5

Multinational enterprises,"Multinational enterprises have been more and more popular in today’s business world. It is claimed that these enterprises arise plenty of opportunities for the host countries; simultaneously, they are also pregnant with drawbacks in some fields.

Transitional corporations ate really motivation for less developed nations. Firstly, thanks to the projects in building factories and infrastructure, they create jobs for a great number of people in the local regions and train them to become skilled workers. Secondly, due to their activities these corporations help other nations change economic mechanism as well as broaden export and import, which enables them to gain further integration into global economy. Internationally viewing, conglomerates are also considered one hope towards hunger eradication and poverty alleviation in developing countries. Additionally, the local industry can get higher technology from foreign countries through transitional companies, which helps improve on technological parameter.

On the other hand, multinational enterprises obviously have definite negative impacts. First, the jobs that they create are not constantly secure because these enterprises could relocate into another country, which is caused by management barriers in the host nation. Second, in developing economics, large multinational companies can make local firms become broke. Last but not least, during maximizing profits, transitional corporations often contribute to pollution in the local areas, which puts the environment under threat.

To summarize, despites causing inevitable negative impact when setting up business in other nations countries, transitional enterprises are evidently appealing to and are welcomed by the nations provided that they practise well corporate social responsibilities apart from making money.

"Thanks to the advent of globalization, big companies have opened their branches in every corner of the world, and thus people reach to buy the same products not only everywhere but also online","Thanks to the advent of globalization, big companies have opened their branches in every corner of the world, and thus people reach to buy the same products not only everywhere but also online. I totally believe that it is negative development because it has a negative effect on the cultures and economies of countries.

To start with, people purchase the same products across the world nowadays. Thus, they might look like the same with each other. It is seen that a number of people around the world wear the product of a well-know brand, and in another case, social media impact on people since influencers advertise these brands on instagram, youtube, etc… They have huge effect on people and people start to buy the same products. Another important issue is that when people wear the same products, I strongly believe that cultural identities can disappear. Every country has its own traditional clothes, however, people tend to purchase popular trend clothes, especially young people. That’s why, young generation ignores their own traditional products.

There is another side, buying the same products might affect economies of countries. Local manufacturers may close their stores, and reduce number of employees. This situation might leads to unemployment. For instance, young generation prefer to buy famous brand for their needs, and they prefer eat fast food rather than their cuisine. As a result of this situation, many local manufacturers might affect negatively. The most important issue is that underdeveloped countries may be foreign dependent. In other words, they can lose their economic independence.

Briefly, as I have mentioned-above, I do believe that it has a negative effect on countries not only economic but also traditional. There is no doubt that cultural of countries may destroyed and unemployment rates may increase day by day.",No,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5

In my opinion, unified world has more merits. My preference is explained further. There are numerous of benefits of living in a globalised world, the formost one is that it leads to progress of nation in every sectors. To explain this, as a country indulge in trade and commerce of various commodities, there is economic growth for all of them due to network word. To add to this, technological advancements of one part can be use in other part as well. For instance, companies in us have outsource customers support to call center in India as there is technology sharing. Furthermore, there are better relation among people of different countries. As they interact with each other, they learn about different cultures. This mostly happens through social medias such as Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp or through communication at work places. This makes people more open minded, consequently they would easily accept other style of living. On the contrary, there some demerits linked with globalization. To commence with, the culture may face degradation. The indigenous way of living may get extinct. by this means dressing sense, eating habits, music, languages, customs, as a result of adopting new culture. In conclusion, globalization is a trend and will stay throughout the 21st century. Although there are some adverse impacts of it. the positive outweighs devastating effects.

Secondly, most essential information about a nation is written in its language. Writing is a way to preserve and maintain knowledge from generation to generation.

globalization - The world is getting smaller,"Globalization is the spread of products, technology, cultures, brands, information, and jobs

across borders. In economic terms, it describes an interdependence of nations around the

globe fostered through free trade. A lot of people say that because of Globalization the world

is getting smaller. As a result, many people say that globalization makes the world smaller

and smaller because we are connected to each other by many things and are therefore equal

but is the world really getting smaller?

According to the text globaization is being able to buy whatever you like where ever you like.

Nowadays it is possible to buy different brands anywhere and not only clothes are availebel

in every country but food for example fast food chains like Mc Donalds or Starbucks. I think

that with the sentence the world is getting smaller is meant that we all exchange very much

about information, trends and cultures that we dont realize that it is already noticeable for

example when you enter a country nothing is very new there are many things we also have

and it is things we know from films and Tv. People feel connected to each other and do not

realize that this information has traveled all around the world.

To sum up the world is really getting small but i dont think it is a bad thing this era of quick

transportation and telecommunication all the world is now a global village. So, from the

globalization people will learn from each other. Hence, culture will be identified and tagged

Many people feel that multinational companies are not good for a country. Why do you think they feel this way? What can be done to minimize the harmful effects of multinational companies?,"It is believed that multinational corporations have negative effects on a nation. In this essay I will discuss the reasons why multinational companies is occuring, and offer some viable solutions to mitigate the problem.

Fundamentally, there are two main causes of multinational companies which are not great for a nation. The primary cause of this is they bring many conveniences to everyone. For example, in Binh Duong the majority of people are likely to go to the AEON mall to purchase everything because there are many shops selling from local foods to unique cuisine all over the world. In addition, many graduates prefer working in international organizations rather than working for the state. This is because most young people like working in a modern environment which uses foreign languages to communicate, besides, they are often offered high salaries and have more opportunities to advance in their careers.

Despite these challenges, there are a variety of possible solutions available to decrease harmful impacts of companies participating in global chain supply. First, the government should have some possible policies to attract many investors around the world to invest in national companies. To illustrate, the state should create a professional environment to develop employer’s creativity as modern-tech equipment. Furthermore, the local companies increase the amount of advertising on social media networks to get to know everybody. Nowadays many multinational companies often appear on TV a lot leading to be known by potential consumers whereas traditional factories do not find the importance of advertising.

In conclusion, the effects of multinational corporations is an issue which will continue to demand our attention for the foreseeable future. However, I feel that the best way to solve this issue is by governments doing their best to make life enjoyable in their home countries. If they implement the measures I have described, this could go some way towards resolving the issue",Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6.5

People are familiar with the word, globalization, for quite decades and they also realize how it benefits their lives, for example, the globalization secretly eases their daily routines from the moment they wake up to the time they go to bed, surprisingly some of them do not even notice. The first thing people get from being in globalized era is that they can break the barriers of all cultures in the world since it is effortless to absorb every new tradition and culture by not presenting in those of each country but just to learn from their world in the form of World Wide Web. Moreover, the globalization brings out people’s creativities through the periods. Due to the fact that technologies and transportations take a huge leap, time can be shortened by those facilities. Consequently, creativities and other concepts are constantly built up, polished then finalized as the finest diamonds: new smartphones, new delivery methods and new Unicorns.

The great success always comes with endless responsibilities. Drawbacks to stepping in this great period of time are apparent and we still have no clue about who hereby to take these responsibilities. While we are unconsciously taking advantages from a new updated GPS to help us get to the destination precisely and quickly, sometimes, at some point, deforestation repeatedly occurs leading to wildlife habitat invasion. Some species are in the brink of extinction and the scientists or environmentalists are trying to tackle the problem, still they get lost and, in this case, GPS cannot get them out. Privacy issue cannot be left unsaid. Clouds are not just a natural storage for rain, but for our data as well. Not only do we need to pay for them, but they are pricy and contain a great amount of personal information protected by the clouds issuers who promise us to keep it safe. In many cases, the news proved it wrong. Since our personal data leaks from time to time. We trade our private lives with the globalization and you can do the math whether it is worth or not.

We need to balance, that is the key to live with globalization, in my view. We occasionally adopt some approaches while trying to leave out the unnecessary parts. To compensate such as planting more trees or using plastic bags is another choice to harmonize human advancement with the way things should be. ",No,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5
In many developing countries of the world more and more multinational companies are being built. What are advantages and disadvantages ?,"In today's world of globalization, a growing number of transnational corporations are being established in a lot of underdeveloped countries. Doubtlessly, it can bring benefit for both enterprises and host countries with permanent jobs and transofrmation of latest technology. But, on the other hand, strong market competition and the extra consumption of natural resources can be one of the main drawbacks in some cases. As multinational companies have been increased in number and appeared in nearly all points of the world, they create a great job opportunities for local people. Moreover, these corporations can have a positive effect on the technological advancement of a country via investing a large capital to bring modern equipment. Due to the aformentioned factors, the economic condition of the country might grow which can lead to the rise in the number of financially well families. As a result of strong competition between international corporations and local companies, the latter might face several hardships. Numerous consumers can choose foreign products because of their better quality and lower price. It can lead to the profit reduction of the local vendors, and in some cases, it cause to the bankruptcy. Apart from this, as establishing the branch companies and manufacturing goods or materials require a vast amount of raw materials require a vast amount of resources, it can serves as one of the main disadvantages. Because several natural resources, for instance, oil, coal, natural gas are limited resources and extra utilization of them by factories can cause numerous inevitable consequences including ecological changes. According to the recent studies, by 2050, a vast number of creatures will extinct as a result of extra using the resources continuously which causes deforestation, desertification and greenhouse effect. Multinational companies undoubtedly have a various positive impact on the development of a state, but at the same time, could bring several serious issues.",No,No,No,No,No,No,5.5
"Globalization is a positive change in economics but, we should not neglect their negative effects. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","There are ample advanced options, which are related to globalisation it aid to boost our economy, while drawbacks should not be neglected by humans, which are hazardous for humans and air. I am, nevertheless, holding a diplomatic view. Both the aspects shall be discussed in the forthcoming paragraphs before reaching a reasoned conclusion.

There seem to be two main reasons stemming from this situation. To begin with, saving time is essential for every human begins, owing to innovation of technology, dream come true, and they are doing a lavish amount of activities by utilizing various type of application within a minute. In recent times, they prefer to purchase junk diet. Therefore, tomato, for instance, is the famous for delight food in worldwide wide. Moreover, they have gained knowledge for reading a review then they select a food item. Hence, a lot of information has been accumulated in sitting on a chair rather than moving around different land.

As far as the eventualities of merits are concerned, we can not neglect demerits, which are extremely hazardous for humans health. If they spend most of their time on front of screen. They will become introvert and suffer from a disease such as, thyroid, diabetes and most common is obesity. Furthermore, They can not find new place and get chance to learn additional culture and language. Meanwhile, humans can not connect with real world. Additionally, they consume plenty of electricity each day so that pollution has been increased.

Gist of the paragraph is: Protecting environment and health is arduous sometimes by using funds

To conclude, globalization plays a vital role to ameliorate our economies by utilising various advance functions, although there are abundant of drawbacks that can not be neglected, which have detrimental for the community as well as surrounding air.",Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6.5
In today's globalization trend,"In today's globalization trend, along with the outstanding development of engineering, technology, medicine, language is also an indispensable part. There is no denying the importance of English because it seems to be the common language of the world that is used globally. Language is not only a means of communication but also a tool for thinking. This is also the reason many people think: ""Knowing one more foreign language is knowing another world"". Foreign languages ​​direct us to the outside world, bringing us closer to the achievements of another country.

Especially for Vietnam, a country that promotes economic integration, the future generations of the country in general, for students in particular, learning English has become more necessary than ever. English is an important condition for you to access and update knowledge sources from around the world and develop in your work. Understanding that, Vietnam's education system has introduced English as the main subject from the primary years and is also a compulsory graduation exam at all levels.

Foreign language learning is gradually becoming an inevitable and mandatory trend, especially for young scientists, when the internet has become popular and online search engines are expanding, but one reality is that most of this document is written in English. Without foreign languages, young people will be very disadvantaged, even difficult to do research and exchange ideas. Understanding the importance of English, a series of English training centers are springing up like mushrooms across the country. Among them, EAP Center is proud to be one of the prestigious and quality centers in Ho Chi Minh city. ",No,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5
multinational organisations,"Multinational organisations can be found in most major cities around the world these days. Although working for such a company provides the opportunity to mix with people from a variety of cultural backgrounds, I would argue that this is not necessarily the best way to learn about other cultures.

There is no doubt that for some people, working for a multinational organisation will enhance their understanding of other cultures. The first reason is that in a multinational organisation one can learn about the customs and traditions of other countries through mixing with people from different backgrounds who work in the company or in liaising with colleagues abroad. Exposure to other languages is also likely, something that gives a much greater depth of understanding of a culture. There may also be the chance to relocate to work in another country, which would mean complete immersion in that culture.

However, there are a number of reasons that it is not necessarily the best way. Firstly, there is no guarantee that you will be a person who gets such exposure to other cultures as it depends on your position within the company. Not all employees have roles where they regularly mix with other cultures. Also, there are also other excellent ways to achieve such a goal. For example, many people these days travel the world, and this is an opportunity to meet and spend time with people from other countries. It is also possible to do voluntary work with organisations and charities that work in other countries, something that would mean you meet a mix of people rather than just those who work in companies.",No,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5
discuss the effects of globalization,"Firstly, globalization creates interconnectedness between communities. Due to immigration and the use of the Internet, most countries are introduced to distinctive ideology, making cultures integrated and diversified. Owing to this, people can have the sense of togetherness with worldwide nations. For example, various kinds of popular music such as jazz, rock, blues, which were originated in the US, have been developed and diversified by worldwide musicians, gathering people with similar interests together.

On the contrary, humans are still concerned about the potentially adverse effects of globalization. Since dominant countries impose ideas and cultural expression on other nations, cultural trade between societies is basically not equal. For instance, because some civilians have expressed apprehension about the monopolistic influence of the US on numerous cultures, such as brands, foods, media, entertainment or lifestyles, the new term ""Americanization” was coined. ",No,No,No,No,No,No,5.5
Discuss the effects of globalization on one aspect of life,"Cultural globalization is the transmission of ideology, meanings or values around the world to extend and intensify social relations. In general, worldwide integration has significantly impacted many cultures in the world both positively and negatively.

Firstly, globalization has some positive effects on each country’s civilization, including interconnectedness and cultural awareness. Due to immigration, most nations are introduced to distinctive values by modern transportation systems and the Internet, making cultures integrated and diversified. Owing to this, people can have the sense of togetherness and connection with worldwide communities. For example, various kinds of popular music such as jazz, rock, blues are developed and diversified by worldwide musicians and singers, gathering people with similar interests together. Moreover, globalization enhances the awareness of cultural identity. Evidently, as civilizations are integrating speedily, some people are more conscious of introducing their original values worldwide. To clarify, although Vietnam is on the verge of international integration, its customs and traditions are still in the state of preservation by the Government.

On the contrary, humans are still concerned about the potentially adverse effects of globalization. Because dominant countries impose ideas and cultural expression on other nations, cultural trade between societies is basically not equal. Therefore, some civilians have expressed apprehension about the lack of national identity of each country in the future. For instance, the new term ""Americanization” was coined owing to the monopolistic influence of the US on many other cultures, such as brands, foods, media, entertainment or lifestyles.

To conclude, the influences of cultural globalization can be either a benefit or a burden. Therefore, it is crucial that nations embrace new innovations appropriately to both advance and preserve original cultures. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6
Globalization is important. What is your opinion? Give your reasons.,"It is a true fact that in modern world globalisation plays a vital role for the growth of nation’s economy. In this case, whether globalisation is essential or not is a matter of discussion. However, before outlining a reasonable conclusion, this essay will fairly decide about the importance of globalization.

There are various factors which prove that how globalisation contribute the GDP of a country. First and foremost, investment of foreign countries could be a significant reason to be considered. It is generally believed that if investment come from outside, it help to grow a nation globally. The fact can be demonstrated by the world bank from 2014, which proved that developing countries can produce internationally 40 % more. Moreover, it increase per capita income of the country may be another reason to take into account. Therefore, it is apparent why globalization is significant.

Despite of reasons discussed above in regard to benefits of globalization there are more reasons for example it allows multi national companies to find low cost ways to produce their products. China is the perfect example, these days, all the MNC’s are sourcing their products from china, which is beneficial for china as well as buyer country. Furthermore, it increases global competition, which drives price down and up the level of quality can be another imperative plus point.

In conclusion, indeed, there are numerous positive points in favour of globalisation. Hence as far as I am concerned, in this era the whole world needs to be globalise if the nations want to expand globally. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,7
Globalisation get nation together .is it positive and negative development,"The importance of nation together which was always debatable has now become controversial with many people claiming that it is beneficial while others reject this notion. In my perspective, the former proportion appears to be more rational. This essay will further explain both positive and negative effects of this trend.

There are myraid of merits which will further explain this argument but the most preponderant one steams from the fact that, when the availability of other nations product in particular nation then, the multide of that nation easily buy import product. Another pivotal aspect of this argument is that, if any product available in wide variety as well as, quality then, citizen of that country esaily choose their preferable product from market. Needless to say, all these merits are stand in a good stead.

However, there are some pitfals that negate these argument and which can certainly overwhelm the potential influence of this trend but one of the most alarming one is that, when the import product is available in market then, automatically masses can attract by that product. Consicuently, the local marketeres get into financial loss because, there monthly or weekly sale would be decrease. Hence, it is apparent why many are against this trend.

According to the arguments aforementioned above, one can reach to a conclusion that the benefits of nations together are instrumental indeed. Nevertheless, the potential drawbacks should not be overlooked",Yes,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5
"Some people think that the government should provide assistance to all kinds of artists including painters, musicians and poets. However, other people think that this is a waste of money. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Many people lives are richer because of their art which they express to community. Many individual believe that the government should provide funds to artist while other believe that it is unfair. This essay analyse both the perspectives.

To begin with former views, there are many points that authority should help artists. Artists are contribute to nation by their art. Creativity is having in every person by their born but to elaborate it is a vital thing for any individual and all artist do that. At the end, they serve their creativity to their community for entertain perpose. Additionally, artist represent their culture by their art so, they become ambassador of their nation. For an example, painters represent their art by emboss as well as sculpture represent by carving and engraving and could be popular worldwide and express their tradition.

Moving to a latter view counter of former view having a strong reasons. Government should firstly focus on basic need for developing country. Individual's primary need is accommodation shelter and food yet, many individual has not get it. For well being life of human is a foremost priority for authority and still thye focus on other art instead this primary things. Additionally, they should also focus on infrastructure development. Nation want to add their name in developed country, foremost of it is developed their urban, ruler and their transportation by providing more found in it.

To conclude and my opinion is, although the art is part of culture and feelings of individual, providing a primary need of citizen is essential for any country. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,5.5
The idea of having single career option is becoming old fashioned one. The new fashion mil be to have several career or way of earning money and further education will be something that continuous throughout life.,"The perception of having only single career becomes outdated now. The new goal is to have numerous career option to generate passive income and to implement life long learning.

I am very truly agreed with the above mentioned statement. Because today's world demands to be entrepreneur. As the old method to study and getting jobs doesn't works anymore. For example if a student is studying in the stream of business. He prefers to generate passive income from number of sources, as internet provides a lot of opportunities to earn without doing a lot of hustle bustle.

On the hand it is necessary to have two or more career options because sometimes you are unable to earn that much from a single source to fulfill your desires. Also the modern world has lot of opportunities but difficulties to. And if a person is depends upon a single career and he or she if loses his job, then this might be impossible from him to survive for longer period of times. Although the modern era demands us to implement life long learning throughout our life. As new technology is upgrading day by day. And we have to develop our skill set accordingly. For example: if you are a shopkeeper, the old methods of selling products doesn't works anymore, people wants everything at there ease and he or she will nit going to wait for longer period to buy something from the shop. Therefore the shop keeper has to use his critical thinking skills and sell it's products with ease by converting his shop to grocery store which will relax him and his customers too. To conclude that i would say that I am fully agreed that a single career option doesn't works anymore. And a person has to think to generate income from numerous sources. We have to enhance our skill set thorough out our life and implement it in our business or work",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,5.5
"In most cultures,people are taught to respect the elderly. Is it important to respect the elderly? How does one demonstrate respect to the elderly?Be specific and give concrete response","In a big number of countries, the majority of people are taught to show respect to the older generations. This is something really significant and can be shown in a lot of ways some of which are going to be mentioned below. To begin with, respecting the elderly it is of a high importance because are the ones who raised and educated us. This means that they already have sacrified a lot in order for us to become successful adults and one of the minimal things that we could do is appreciate them. Besides this we need to maintain this kind of behaviour around them because they always were beside us during difficult times so we can feel at ease again and get a hold of ourselves. No matter how you see it they have done a great deal of things for us so respecting them is a must. Obviously, there are a lot of ways to show your respect one of which is to help them do things they are not able to do anymore like lifting heavy objects. We could also provide them with food and medicine when nessecery just like they did it for us when we were young to show them that we appreciate what they have done through all these years. And last but not least is to make sure when we don't see them to call them so they can feel loved and that there are people that care for them. In conclusion, respecting elderly should be a characteristic of every young persons personality for a lot of reasons and there plenty ways to accomplish this. Fortunately, this kind of behaviour is being adopted by more and more individuals leading to a reassuring future. ",No,No,Yes,No,No,No,5
"A person's worth nowadays seems to be judged according to social status and material possessions,old fashioned values such as kindness,honour and trust no longer seem important.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?","Today, wealthy and influential people get more accolades of members of the society than people with noble character. While l agree that self importance is attributed to social class and how rich a person is, l do not agree individuals with good integrity are considered less significant in the society.

On the one hand, being affluent command respect and acceptance by community members as majority of people believe only the rich can take up leadership role in key political positions. Furthermore, judging individuals worth based on the magnitude of their material possession affect contributions to the growth and development of the community in which they reside. A good example of this is the wealthy people voted for based on their social contributions to their community in 2019 election in Nigeria to occupied various political post.

However, I disagree with the idea that people of reputable quality are less essential this day as they used to be in time past. Just as material possession is important so also is a man's integrity in today's society. People of good moral standard serves as role model for generation to come. Equally, individuals with good character impact others positively more especially the youths. For instance, parents of high moral standard influences their children in a positive way to be good children just like them.

In conclusion, although members of the society value and respect people due to their material possession, I believe that people of good uprightness are still considered more crucial and hold in high-esteem in the society. ",Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6.5
The idea of having a single career is becoming an old fashioned one. The new fashion will be to have several careers or ways of earning money and further education will be something that continues throughout life.,"Nowadays it is very common that people pursue more than occupation. People are now attracted in different professions to make healthy savings. Basically, there are two main reasons lie in this fact. One cause is, the ever-changing technology and the other one is financial conditions. Consequently, people are eager to learn and develop new skill sets to adopt to the new living conditions.

Science and Technology opens a new avenue in modern life. It has a greater ripple effect on every humankind. This improvement has changed the thought process and attitude of every working individuals. The impact of technological change are enormous. It pairs very well between the labor and capital to generate revenue. For example, the automobile industry uses the computer programs to improve the fuel efficiency. Many other inventions have similar effects. Not only it creates new job scope, it also allows people to learn different field work and excel simultaneously. From a recent survey, it is revealed that, more than 100 skill centers are created in every town due to raising job positon and demand from people to take multiple courses.

On the other hand, soaring competition also encourage people to explore more than one area. Job security is no longer guaranteed in any organization. People may lose job anytime and to protect themselves from such catastrophic effect, they are working two or three jobs. For example, a sales man not only works as marketing executive but also a real-estate agent. A computer engineer may run a blog on free time to make extra savings for his family. Hence, the fact is very clear that, there is no one want to risk or take chances on their financial security and stability. The evolution of internet and telecommuting is inevitable which motivate people to be more enthusiastic and work from anywhere without quitting their full-time job.

To conclusion, growth of technology and financial instability are the factors to drive people to pursue multiple careers. The availability of new roles in the market just made easily accessible for them. ",No,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5
"In most cultures, people are taught to respect the elderly. Is it important to respect the elderly? How does one demonstrate respect to the elderly?Be specific and give concrete response","It is a pretty well known fact, that in the majority of countries people show respect to the elderly ones. This gesture shows good behavior and discipline. In my opinion it is very important to demonstrate respect to the elderly people for many reasons, which many of them will be examined below.

To start with, in my country Greece the demonstration of respect to the old people is something that someone can be find in every family and in every person’s principals, with very little exceptions. We believe that this is very important for them because as time goes by they get older and they feel more lonely and disappointed, so what we have to do is to show them our love and appreciation. Moreover, it is a usual phenomenon that when the parents are in work they call their kids’ grandparents to keep an eye on them until they come back. I believe that this is a very serious reason to respect our grandparents and generally the elderly people

There are many ways to show our respect to an old person. In case he is a relative of us, we can show our respect and love by giving him a kiss or call him for a dinner. Furthermore, a good option is to buy him a gift that he was always wanted. Also if we see someone old enough who cannot pass the driveway, it will be great for him to help him pass easy and safe. Last but not least we should avoid talking to them baldly and not paying attention to them because they feel sad something that is very bad for an old person.

To end up I deeply believe that we must show respect and have time with the elderly people because they deserve it and that will make happy not only us but the old person too. ",Yes,No,No,No,No,No,5.5
"It is commonly believed that nowadays main factors that affect a child's development are media, pop culture and friends. A different point of view is that family plays the most significant role. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","A person's personality is formed under the influence of family upbringing and external factors. Some people argue that external factors such as peer, media and teacher pressures have more effect on children temper than family. This essay will discuss both these points of view and argue in favour of the latter.

One the one hand, The books children read and the music they listen, form their beliefs and faiths. In other words, children tend to follow and imitate the behaviour of their favourite personality. Moreover, when a children are in school or play in playground, they are influenced by their peers. Finally, other factors, like the media, prompt children to want things regarded as fashionable. For instance, children demand toys that they see on television. Therefore, some people argue that external factors have an undeniable influence on the life of children and are predominant in shaping their future.

On the other hand, a child's personality is malleable at a very young age, and parents are often present in their life at this stage. Also, very young children love to imitate their parent's behavior. For example, children who have a dysfunctional family often exhibit behavioural problems at school. That is while, An emotionally safe home environment is critical for the child's confidence. Moreover, parents also teach children about setting boundaries. It is their behavior and upbringing that teaches children what friends to choose, what books to read, and what movies to watch.

Therefore, In my opinion, children's choice of friends, books or music and etc. depends on the values inspired in them by their parents. Therefore, parents hold more substantial mastery over their offspring than media, pop culture and friend groups.

In conclusion, it is undeniable that the outside world affects the intellectual and social development of children. However, I believe that it is the parents who, from a very young age, provide the ground for the positive or negative direction of these developments. ",Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,7
In the past people wore their traditional clothes and followed their culture. These days most people wear similar clothes and therefore look very similar to one another. Do you think this is a positive or a negative development?,"These days, people’s perspectives on the value of clothing are changing, and individuals tend to wear similar clothing compared to people in the past who opted for their traditional clothing. I believe this tendency exerts a positive influence on the society.

It is certainly true that there are some drawbacks to this tendency because it may lead to a loss of global diversity. It can be argued those who wear ordinary clothes such as T-shirts and jeans cannot feel a connection to their roots, and they are likely to neglect their culture and the contribution of their ancestors. Therefore, these people may not take pride in their region, and they might migrate to an urban location rather than contribute to the development of their community. Consequently, many ethnic minorities could suffer from the depopulation and eventually disappear.

However, I believe that there are more positives than negatives in people opting for similar clothes. The first explanation is that individuals can feel a sense of unity with people all over the world even though they have different religions and ways of life. This mind would motivate people in the world to support one another, instead of thinking that different parts of the world should deal with their own problems when natural disasters and other terrible problems occur in different nations. Furthermore, this tendency is economically profitable. Generally speaking, as ordinary clothes are automatically manufactured, they can be produced faster and more affordably than traditional clothing such as Japanese Kimono, which is hand-crafted.

In conclusion, although people today tend to wear similar clothes instead of traditional ones and this trend will cause several problems, I believe that the society as a whole can reap more benefits of this tendency. ",Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6.5
"In some cultures, children are often told that they can achieve anything if they try hard enough. What are the advantages and disadvantages of giving children this message?","It’s an accepted fact that many cultures are told the children that they can achieve anything if they try hard enough. This message is good to motivates children in real life, that they must to work harder to raise what they want. But sometimes there are situation that make this message have negative impact for children.

From the one side, this message is useful for everyone especially for children, cause this message told them to be more productive in their live, doing a good activity and always have a positive thinking on the future of their live. After take the message the children will applied the message in their activity, make them always encourage their skill and do a positive activity. Example, when this message is giving to the children, especialy who want to be a soccer players in the future, so this message will always support them to practice to play soccer every day. And when he down, he will remember this message and it can make them up again to doing more practice.

On the other side, giving children this message have negative impact in some situations. As we know, that it is not always easy to raise or get what we want in the world. Especially when we grow in mature, that we should be an independent people, when there are many problems that we should face. If this message is implayed, people can be tired and will get depression because they cannot get what they want.

In conclusion, this message can bring a positive impact when we use this to motivate ourself. But when we didn’t seeing the reality of life and always trust only to this message and didn’t compare, it will make us feel depressed because we cannot control the whole world as we need.

"Students should focus on learning in the classroom rather than show their status by wearing fashionable clothes.Therefore ,all students have to wear school uniforms do you agree or disagree with this statement. Therefore","It is often considered that, of late, uniform plays a fundamental role of an every student. It has been prevailing a significant concern in all over the world. The sea change has been witnessed in the past few years. As per the stated notion, youngsters should have to emphasize on their studies instead to showing their status by wearing casual. The following paragraphs would elucidated by students have to wear school uniforms. To embark on, there are major concerns by uniform is significant for future custodians. First and foremost, it is the code of conduct of an each school which would develop a deeper understanding will strengthen their performance or ability. For instance; if student tiring a dress it would not create a discrimination between rich and destitute people which is considered having had a efficacious effect on both the individual and society. Thus, this approaches wide-ranging and inspiring.

On the other hand, high- toned attires are not suitable for them. Since educational institutions are for studying despite to show their status. Moreover discipline is a major practice of life which every individual should attain. For example, Uniform would be a more effective strategy for improving discipline especially in schools and organisations. Therefore this is a contributing factor.

To recapitulate, although several children do not like to wear uniform because they feel uncomfortable, I strongly agree, by doing this it will help them reintegrate back into society and give them some means of support. ",No,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5

People all over the world listen to music. Why is music important to so many cultures? Give specific details and reasons to support your viewpoint.,"It is a widely known fact that music is something that exists in every country and all over the world. It plays a significant part in peoples’ lives as it enhances them with a full of beneficial things, which many of them will be examined below.

First of all, music contributes to the emotions of people. Many times we see, at clubs, parties or live events, thousands of people to entertain their selves and have fun only by hearing the type of music that they like. Also there is a usual thing to put a specific type of music according to the emotions we feel that moment.

Some people say that it's possible to tell a lot about a person's culture and character from the choice of clothes. Do you agree or disagree?,"It is commonly argued that a person’s clothing highly represents their personality and also the society where they reside. I firmly advocate this point of view as I believe that the colour of people’s clothes is rooted in the nations’ culture, and in personal terms, the cleanliness of one’s garments shows how disciplined that person is.

Regarding the social aspects of attire, it is widely debated that they can indicate numerous facts about a nation’s culture. To be more specific, the outstanding colours observed in the clothes in society may represent the rate of happiness. For example, Being delighted, individuals tend to wear the clothes with bright colours, but on the other side, they put on the ones in black when unhappy or depressed. While there is no doubt that people sometimes wear black clothes in winter just to attract less cold, it is almost clear that dark colours are indicators of depression.

Moreover, clothing could be also discussed in personal terms because the cleanliness of one’s garment represents how disciplined he/she is in life. The reason is that the people who are highly obsessed with tidiness and cleanliness at home or workplace may have the same obsession in their appearance as well. For instance, an employee in wrinkled trousers and bad-smelled shirts is perceived to have an untidy and smelly home as well. While many individuals believe in a famous expression that “don’t buy a book from its cover”, the role of personal discipline in wearing neat clothes has been accepted by many psychologists.

In conclusion, I agree with this statement that people’s clothing is deeply rooted in their culture and personality because many items such as colour can tell about a nation’s overall happiness rate, and the tidiness of one’s clothes could represent his/her discipline in life.

"It is generally believed that some people are born with certain talents, for instance for sport or music, and others are not. However, it is sometimes claimed that any child can be taught to become a good sports person or musician. Discuss both these views and e your own opinion","When it comes to skills like music and sports, it is a common concept that only the people born with the certain talents can accel in that field. While many believe that skill and talent is not an inborn trait but can be instilled into a person to make him good in the respective field.

It is certainly true that some people are born talented and with minimal training and support they can become very successful. Undoubtedly, some are born musicians and have these skills passed onto them from their ancestors. In the similar fashion, sportsmanship also tends to run in the families. In the sub-continent, the Fateh family is quite famous when it comes to music. They have produced great musicians over the years, their fore-fathers were among the best musicians of their times. This talent has been passed onto the younger generations, who are now one of the most successful and famous musicians of the music industry.

On the other hand, it is widely believed that skills like music and athletic talents can be developed in a person with practice and hard-work and is not merely a matter of inborn traits. We have seen many athletes who had come from an anonymous background with minimum opportunities available, but their passion and craze for the particular sports made them to work endlessly until they achieved expertise in that field. A famous Pakistani bowler, Muhammad Aamir belonged to a anonymous town of Paskistan and used to play cricket in the streets of his town but his passion drived him to learn the skill to became one of the best bowlers of the World.

In conclusion, it is true that talents do run in the families and some people are born skilled. However, it is not a given that only naturally talented individuals can prosper in the fields like music and sports, but these expertise can be achieved over time with practice and training.

Cultures around the world becoming more and more similar,"It is said that in today's globalized world cultures and traditions are indistinguishable to compare to last decades. This essay will discuss the main causes why people face to similarity are of influence wastern culture and give some possible development to this. To my mind, this have more negative outweigh positive.

First of all, in this day and age advertisement are ubiquitous and play pivotal role in promoting latest trend and fashion followed by some developed countries. Many developing cultures people trying to adapt to the modern culture whether what it is about food, clothes and music. Furthemore, in social media sites especially young generations have common interests about music and they may immatiate to their fans with a lot of ways such as they reply to dance on behind tiktok dancers, girls who like to follow follow models are tend to make up their face, change their styles to look like like a kind of puppet or some open clothes attract more and more young people that it is seen as an image of modernity Personally i believe that this does not conform to the custom of some eastern peoples or some individuals argue that distorts the behaviour of the people

Secondly, It is true that when people travel to abroad, it is comforting to use leisure amenities, people can eat in their favourite food no matter where this produced and listen some kind of music such as English music popular with everyone. Besides, this helps also economy of nation as international industry development and attracts more tourists.

Business culture in globalization impact on an international business with operations in different countries.,"Over the last three decades, a fundamental shift has been occurring in the world economy. We are moving toward a world in which barriers to cross-border trade and investment are declining; perceived distance is shrinking due to advances in transportation and telecommunications technology; material culture is starting to look similar the world over, and national economies are merging into an interdependent, integrated global economic system. The process by which this is occurring is commonly referred to as globalization.

Globalization has resulted in greater cross-national business and cultural interactions. This also means the business culture has considerable importance for an international business with operations in different countries. When you’re dealing with people from another culture, you may find that their business practices, communication, and management styles are different from those to which you are accustomed. Understanding the culture of the people with whom you are dealing is important to successful business interactions and to accomplishing business objectives.

Occasionally business culture will affect your ability to enter an international market, develop and maintain business relationships, negotiate successful deals, conduct sales, conduct marketing, advertising campaigns, engage in manufacturing, and distribution.

In conclusion, we need to understand the point of view of people who worry about cultural globalization because it is a threat to national traditions. However, this is outweighed by its positive impact on international understanding and the fact that it represents progress within a society. ",No,No,Yes,No,No,No,5
Personality of people is reflected by fashion. Do you think it's positive or negative.,"Individual's personality, these days, reflects owing to fashion. Consciousness towards fashionable goods is extremely common among communities. This essay will shed light on reasons behind this, however, I consider it to be a positive trend rather than its negative ones.

The underlying reasons associated with why people's preference is more towards trendy clothes are following. The most dominating reason is that physical appearance becomes a necessary part of individual's life. To explain it, people, in 21st century, have more care about their outside looks rather than inside, therefore, a big chunk of money is consumed by them on fashionable clothing. In addition to this, people consider personality as an imperative part of their life. The standout example of this is that women in new generation have more focus on fashionable products since they consider it to be a success in life. Thereby, from these above mentioned reasons it is proven that fashion should be there in life of folks.

Moreover, for organizations, manufacturing trendy clothes or goods becomes a huge business. To make it more clear, numerous craftman make an effort to design clothes which can also renowned at international level. This development would provide favorable benefits to everyone.

In conclusion, fashion industry is not only achieving huge goals but also offer opportunities for denizens. I perceive that fashion holds Number of benefits for countries progress. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,5.5
music bring people of different cultures together agree or disagree,"It is often said that music has the power to unite and connect people, regardless of their cultural backgrounds or ages. I completely agree with this view, and will give my reasons below.

Music can certainly reach across cultural and national boundaries and bring people together. Perhaps the best example of this would be the Live Aid concerts that took place back in the 1980s, and which were broadcast to a global audience. Two live events were held simultaneously in the UK and the US, and the objective was to raise funds for famine relief in Ethiopia. The concerts were a huge success, both in terms of the number of people around the world who watched them and their impact on international public awareness of the famine. They demonstrated, I believe, that music truly is the planet’s global language.

Just as it transcends cultures, music also has the ability to connect people from different generations. Regardless of age, we can all enjoy a memorable melody, a strong rhythm or a beautiful singing voice, and the best songs seem to have the same magical effect on all of us. This would explain why televised music competitions, such as ‘The X Factor’ or ‘The Voice’, are such popular prime-time shows. These programmes attract incredibly broad audiences because singing and popular songs appeal to children, parents and grandparents alike. I would argue that no other form of entertainment can bring families together in this way.

In conclusion, I believe that music is unique in its capacity to create shared experiences between people, irrespective of culture and age. ",Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,5.5
Some people believe that the Internet brings people of different ages and cultures together. To what extent do you agree with this opinion?,"It is widely believed that as electronic devices became more advanced, people began to communicate more over the internet, bringing them closer together. On the contrary, there is a certain group of people who believe that the Internet has pushed people far apart. Before coming to a logical conclusion, we'll look at both sides and I will explain further in this essay.

To begin with, we must acknowledge how technological advancements have altered the whole world and brought individuals from all over the planet together with a single touch. In the past, sending a message to another location would take a long time, or you could have to go to their location to give the message, which was inefficient and time-consuming. Now, we just engage with each other, and the message is sent to their side in a second. Consequently, People, particularly adolescents, begin enjoy conversing through numerous online sites as technology progresses at a breakneck rate, because it helps them to keep in touch with their distant relatives and friends. For example, Facebook, a widely used social networking site, has millions of members who connect with one another on a regular basis, sharing their thoughts on a variety of issues and forming communities with others who have shared interests.

On the other hand, while the Internet connects people digitally, it isolates them socially in the meantime, because the more time they spend online, the less time they spend engaging in real life. People who are hooked to the internet and can't get away from their devices will not develop any social skills or gain any knowledge that’s essential for their lives. This is a major disadvantage since it will put them in perplexing situations that they won't know how to handle. Many people assume that technological communication is less comprehensive and trustworthy than communication done by face-to-face conversation or over the phone. Social connections are built on the facades of other internet users, whose anonymous activities might be deceptive and unpredictable.

To sum up, despite all of this, I continue to notice flaws in the evolution of interface technologies since there is an enormous amount of time each person spends on the Internet and separates from each other. But we can’t forget to mention the contributions that technology has made to human contact, and I believe that the mentioned flaw is easily remedied. ",No,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5

Because of the different setting, the first interac between the writer and the bird is also not the same. With an excited emotion when she saw the hawk for the first time, Helen lightly slowly softly covered the hawk’s eyes with the hood with a series of actions which was described as: ”I grabbed the hood from the box and turned to the hawk. Her beak was open, her hackles raised; her wild eyes were the colour of sun on white paper, and they stared because the whole world had fallen into them at once. One, two, three. I tucked the hood over her head. ” while the writer of “An unexpected meeting” with the altruism try to save the penguin at all cost even in a violent way like: “. . . Swirling a piece of fishing net, I distracted the penguin and, with the swiftness and bravery of Achilles2, dropped the net over its head and pushed it over with a stick. I pinned it down and, with my hand inside the bag (it was no time to be eating apples), grabbed its feet. ”.

In this time of advanced technology it is hard to say that this world is old-fashioned. But is caring for our environment is old-fashioned? It seems that every country in the world has with pollution. I think that these problems can be fixed.

It seems that every country in the world has with pollution. I think that these problems can be fixed. But where do we start?

We begin with transport. Emissions from cars greatly damage the environment and the fact that almost every citizen has one doesn’t make it any better. A good solution to that would be to motivate people to use electric cars. The second place to check would be rivers and seas. Anything from sunken transport to waste thrown out by people should be cleaned since it creates trouble both for animals and us. The third problem would be littering. Why? Because a lot of packaging used and thrown away is not biodegradable. Keeping the package on your person and throwing it away at the bin should do the trick.

In conclusion, I have shown you that we have a lot of problems with taking care of environment, but we have the solutions to them. All we need is just enough time and effort.

Part 2. 3

Throughout our lives we learn many things and obtain many characteristics. Some are good, some are bad. It’s really hard to say which one is the most useful. But I would say that the most useful thing I have ever learned is the ability to look at life a little more easier and find balance in things you do on every day basis.

You can’t expect great work if you don’t have a great rest. These things are pretty proportional, in my opinion. Not only that, living in constant stress and work won’t do you a lot of good, so a rest that can take care of all that before the next time you sit to do something tedious should be helpful. But don’t let that rest take all of your time or else you’ll fall behind. Plan your time ahead, balance your rest and work so that you won’t be consumed by them. Doesn’t that sound great?

In the end, not everyone will agree with me, but that’s ok. That’s my opinion and I agree with myself. I just wanted to share that thought with anyone reading this. ",No,No,No,No,No,No,5.5
A gossip culture pervades most companies. Employees like to talk about their bosses or other employees. Is there any advantage to this? What do you think are the disadvantages?,"Gossip is a dominant culture in the corporate world. In many circles, gossip is considered as a tool to gather information and build intimacy among colleagues, while others seem it as harmful phenomenon that that destroys trust and assails credibility. In the instance, I am of the honest opinion that gossip is the one of the major adversaries of a healthy corporate culture. In following essay i will discuss both merits and dimerits of gossip culture.

To commence with, there is several reasons which can support th benefits of gossip culture. Gossip, in fact, is nothing but implies office politics. It will be difficult for bosses of big companies to find out about the rumors in the company without gossiping. As a result, the company goes bankrupt. Secondly, not only does gossip harms the intended person, but also everyone in the organization with the help of gossip, the campaign grows faster and its revenue increases dramatically. Thus, gossip spreads quickly among people

On the other hand, big company executives suffer from gossip. To give an illustration of what I mean, to head of company or the employees in company may become unemployed. Also, through gossip company employees commit crimes because this is a case against the law. For instance, coca-cola workers were caught trying to sell company secrets.

Do you agree with the writer's views on the value of modern inventions? Why or why not?,"Modern inventions have made life more comfortable than what it was before. More and more new things are being made in all countries throughout the world to make life even more comfortable.

In the past men had great difficulty in ploughing their lands to grow food. But, today, giant machines are used to plough thousands of acres of land. As a result, more food can be grown in a shorter time than was possible before. To carry the food motor-vehicles, steam-ships and various other means of transport have been invented. Shortage of food in one place no longer causes anxiety as it can be brought from another place within a very short time.

The invention of the means of transport has also made it possible for people to work in places miles away, and children can attend schools in distant places. In the past, this was not possible. The children of today are therefore better educated than those of the past. Invention of the means of transport has also increased human activity. A man can now go to several places, and do a variety of things in a day's time

Other inventions like the radio and the telephone have also contributed much to human progress. The radio keeps us informed about developments in other parts of the world. We do not have to travel to know what is happening in places away from our homes. The telephone too is a convenient means of knowing about others, miles away. It helps in business transactions by reducing time and travel. A businessman in one town can talk to another in another town, several miles away, to do some important business. In all these ways, people are able to do many things without much loss of time.

In the same way, every invention has helped to increase our comforts. Television, for example, now makes it possible for people to stay at home and enjoy. At the same time, however, modern inventions have caused many deaths and much sorrow to many people. Yet modern inventions have

Some people claim that immigrants should adopt the local culture when they arrive in a new country. Others think that they should maintain their culture instead. Discuss both views and give your opinion,"These days, more and more people are moving to new countries to begin a new life. Some argue that these newcomers should take on the local customs, while others believe they should preserve their heritage. I strongly believe that assimilation into the target culture is key for a nation to function as one in order to succeed.

A prosperous country utilizes the power of its people. As such, its citizenry must strive for common goals, which are to become strong, economically secure, and free from outside influence. This happens by creating a communal feeling among the residents. For example, Americans subscribe the melting pot, a concept that emphasizes being American first and Asian, African, or other identity second. Consequently, everyone can be an equal, proud member of the nation and collectively propel it forward. In contrast, focusing on maintaining one’s past traditions makes the goals of the nation becomes secondary.

Another reason to assimilate is to speed up one’s integration into the system by finding a job, making friends, establishing a social safety net, and so on. This begins with language and customs. If one communicates effectively, he can build up his new life successfully. To illustrate, consider the second generation of immigrants; these young people were raised on the local culture, speak the language fluently, and tend to advance further than their parents. This suggests that if the latter had adapted to their new home more quickly rather than holding on to their past, they might have been more successful. Indeed, they did not principally emigrate to another country to conserve or promote their cultures and traditions, but in pursuit of better living conditions.

In conclusion, while one’s heritage is important, it can be detrimental to one’s ability to integrate into a new culture and contribute to its success. Therefore, immigrants should quickly adapt to their new homes. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,5.5
"Nowadays, teamwork is in fashion in the workplace and many people prefer working with a group of people. What are the advantages and disadvantages teamwork brings to people who prefer to do so.","In modern times, the issue of teamwork has become highly controversial. The causes of this phenomenon are varied in the workplace. This essay will outline the reasons why work in a group occurring, and explore some potential solutions to this issue.

Generally speaking, there are a wide range of reasons why people prefer to work in a group. Firstly, teamwork is good for better understanding. When people work in a group, rather than work in alone, it helps them to know better their colleagues. For example, if someone get a job in higher company, they way of work in a group help may their colleagues know very well. Secondly, teamwork is a best place for sharing ideas and experience. This is because, when someone work in a group, they can express their personal ideas and experience, which they learn for their real life. It helps them to broaden their ideas. Furthermore, if people work in a team, they may be capable to critical thinking, which boosts solve problem easily.

On the other hand, there are several throwback works in a group. The primary reason of this idea is that teamwork is time consuming. For example, if people work in a team, sometimes they need too much time for problem solve, and sometimes they wait for other teammates due to his problem. The secondary reason of idea is that work in a group make place congested. This is because, many people work in one place exact time, which hamper main aims of team.

In conclusion, teamwork is a topic which is very relevant to modern society. It is the best way to work in a group, unlike work in alone. If management implements this policy in workplace, it will provide better understanding and work in together. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6
"According to the writer, raising legal driving age are would not really increase road safety. Do you agree with the writer’s views? Why/ why not?","I agree with the writer that raising legal driving age are would not really increase road safety. While I agree that driving age rise can have effective in reducing road accidents, I believe that other factors are equally important. If a person crosses the road unexpectedly, for example, teenagers might be surprised and extremely scared, adults might make quicker and wiser decisions. Besides, I think that there are three better solutions to increase road safety. First of all, the government should encourage people to use public transports instead of private ones in order to reduce the level of accidents. In addition, traffic police should fine traffic violators heavily or take away driver's licenses if they break the law. As a result of stringent traﬃc regulations, drivers will obey the law and accidents decrease. Finally, the authorities should allocate ﬁnancial resources to improving public transport and invest more money in building infrastructures such as one-way roads or dividing lanes for different types of vehicles. That would create better conditions for drivers.

However it will have the impact on children. The children must face ignorance. Women have the ability to groom the personality of the children she focused on the up bring of the children.

Their personalities will not boosted as an example my cousin have bad habits because of the ignorance of her mother and he always be punished for his wrong deeds.

In the society women will get a lot of confidence while working away from home. It will make it very easy for her to survive in case of a single parent. The working women can face every problem very easily and counter those problems. For example in my country women rights are not equal in all the regions of the country for that they must work to get exposure.

Hence I believe that men and women working together make the family survival easy.

"Some people suggest that when we learn a language, we should also learn the cultures and lifestyles of this country.","There’s an ongoing debate of whether or not we should learn the cultures and lifestyles of the country when we want to learn a new language. In my opinion, I fully agree with the viewpoint.

First and foremost, I do agree it is very important for us to learn the grammar and vocabulary if we want to advance a new language. However if we realize, we learned our mother language not by books. We observed how our family communicated, how our teacher told us stories, and then we tried to imitate them. We know when to use formal language, when to use sarcasm, when to talk casually through a life experience. This concept should be applied when we want to learn a new language.

As an Indonesian, I have learned english since kindergarten because it is a must have subject in my school. However, no matter how good my grammatical knowledge is, I still stutter when I talk in English whenever I travel to English speaking countries. I realized this often happens because I didn't understand the culture. For example, in Indonesia or any other asian country, it is highly impolite to talk casually with elderly especially to call them by their names. We usually call our aunt with “tante” before the name or “uncle” if he’s a male. But when I met my American uncle, he told me to just call him Bobby, which is his name. This may seem simple but it actually can dramatically change our relationship.

In conclusion, I highly agree we should also learn the cultures, manager, and lifestyles of the country when we want to advance a new

"When students study a foreign language, they should also study the culture and lifestyle of the people who speak the language. Do you agree or disagree?","Of late, the trends of studying foreign languages like English, French and Chinese are exponentially increasing across the world. In such a situation, some people assert that the students should also study the cultural and lifestyle aspects of the ‘natives’ speaking the particular language they are learning. Nevertheless, I personally disagree with it.

The culture and lifestyle of foreign countries need not be studied by the students due to a variety of reasons. First and foremost, it is critical to recognise that the students’ own cultural traditions and lifestyles are of high significance could be of higher significance. If they study foreign cultures and lifestyles, their native culture will be distorted. For instance, a recent survey by National Geographic magazine exhibited that the local cultural values of have been forgotten by some students who started studying American culture while pursuing education in Mumbai University. Secondly, such study of foreign cultures and lifestyles should not be imposed on anyone. Students, particularly in today’s democratic world, should have their own choice in this regard.

Admittedly, it is also true that while learning a foreign language in a proper way, building an understanding of their ‘native’ cultural values and lifestyle could be a game changer. For this, the students could be required to watch movies of particular cultures. Secondly, this is important to develop a cosmopolitan culture also, which will eventually lead to convergence of diverse cultures across the world. However, in this context, it should not be forgotten that studying foreign culture should be an option, not a compulsion.

On the basis of the above deliberations, it could precisely be concluded that the arguments against compulsion to study foreign culture which learning some language are more convincing and stronger (more substantial) vis-à-vis arguments in its favour. This is, inter-alia, due to the necessity of protection of native culture from distortions. ",No,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5
"Inspite the advancement in agriculture, the world still faces hunger","There are a lot of advancements in the field of agriculture in recent years, but still the world faces the problem of hunger. The main reasons for this scenario is the reduction in farm land and farmers and also insufficient preservation and transportation facilities. Howerver there are various solutions to this problem

Agriculture is improving nowadays due to increased technological advancements. But this is not sufficient to meet the needa of the world. Firstly, the number of farmers and land available for agriculture is plummeting. Current generation is inclined towards white collar jobs such as office works. Moreover, agricultural land is converted into areas for constructing houses and buildings. Secondly, due to poor transportation and preservation technologies the agricultural commodities which are produced in one location is not accessible to other areas. For instance, several news reports have shown the wastage of tomato during harvesting season in the northern part of India due to lack of refrigeration system. All these can cause insufficient food supply around the world.

These problems can be eradicated by various methods. Government should form several schemes to encourage upcoming generation to take up agriculture and also should provide support to farmers like subsidies to promot agriculture. Furthermore, agricultural produce must be preserved and transported to those in need by taking the advantage of technology.

To conclude, many around us are still with empty stomachs even if the technological advancements in agriculture is rising. People should be encouraged to make agriculture their profession and also the food should be made available to those in desperate need. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6
"Reflection about business culture, journalistic translation, culture, and literary translation","During the series of talkshow, I went through four themes including “Business culture in the contemporary business world” by Ph. D Phan Cong Chinh, “Journalistic translation” by M. A Nguyen Thanh Nam, “American pop culture” by Ph. D Hoang Thach Quan, and “Literary translation” by M. A Le Huy Loc.

First and foremost, I would like to give a special thanks for the very informative sharing and meaningful conversation from the four guests, and I would like to give a special thanks for holding these useful talkshow by the teachers from the Faculty of English Linguistics and Literature as well.

As expected, I have a general view of four themes regarding business, journalism, culture, and literature. I will share some of my observations and experience about the talkshow as follows.

Firstly, my observation from the first speaker’s sharing demonstrates that business culture plays a vital role in small and large companies alike. Its aim is to make a connection among employees and enhance the quality and effectiveness of the company as a whole as well as promote its empowerment. In particular, each company creates their own business culture as core values which have a huge impact on every employee. As a fresher, we are distinct individuals with different personalities and perspectives, therefore, it’s essential to learn and be instructed in the core values of the company. As a result, we should know what to do to implement and express the core values effectively. Thus, the training department is supposed to be very important in training people about the mutual business culture regardless of being in any position.

As my experience in a To me, as a will-be graduate, I must have awareness of my almost lack of experience and capacity. Then, I always show my can-do attitude and curiosity and don’t hesitate to ask for help if any difficulties with the hope to best-accomplish the work and contribute to the company’s development.

Secondly, in terms of journalistic translation, it’s not merely translation from the source language to the target language, rather journalistic translators are supposed to collect, edit, and rewrite articles based on many resources in different newspapers in order to publish every type of news in accordance with journalistic style. The aim is to provide the production of news which is reasonable for the specific local audience and the journalistic norms in the region. The importance of copyright of the news in journalism is taken into consideration. The big newspaper offices in Vietnam, for example, almost buy the copyright of subscriptions or the exploitation of the resources, images of the overseas newspaper. Being students in translation and interpreting, we can apply for the collaborator position in some newspaper offices. However, we are not journalists, but translators, thus, we just provide the translation version. To be more professional in journalism, we must possess four requirements including faithfulness, accuracy, effectiveness, and clearness. When translating, editing, writing news, we should take some notice: the six questions principle of writing brief news (who, what, when, where, why, how), the different title between English news and Vietnamese news, and the regular research and update on new terms.

Thirdly, regarding American pop culture, I was introduced to the two distinct definitions of “Culture” and “cultures”.

The cultural framework between Vietnam and America is different, therefore, if we want to understand and not to misunderstand the event, we should put it in the proper context and put on the cultural lens of that particular country.

The percentage of overweight children in western society has increased by almost 20% in the last ten years. Discuss the causes and effects of this disturbing trend.,"A drastic alleviation in number of overweight children has been observed over the last decade. In the modern time, obesity in children has seen a surge of almost 20%. There are several reasons contributing to this as well as it’s potential effects.

Lifestyle choices has led to the emerging issue of obesity in children in western society. Not following a healthy diet is one of the major and important reason for significant increase in the weight. For example, consumption of packed food instead of cooking fresh and healthy meals at home has been an easy and convenient way for children while their mothers are away. Another cause of the problem is lack of exercise. Playing video games on computers and mobile phones have been the first preference of teenagers rather than playing outdoor games in free time. Since there is no or very less body movement, the consumption of calories is very low.

Such a lifestyle can have major effects on the health of the children in long-term. A rise in weight has been observed as the main reason behind many diseases. For instance, diabetes, high cholesterol and so on are faced by people suffering from weight issues. Apart from this, low self-confidence has also been a result of obesity in most of the children. Physical appearance is a confidence booster for all, especially as a child, since people tend to bully fat students.

Poor lifestyle choices like consumption of less nutritious food and not working out has certainly contributed to an increase in percentage of children suffering from overweight. If not properly taken care of, this could result in health problems in the future which can prove to be a disadvantage for the society. ",No,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5
Agrowing number of overweight people is putting a strain on the health system to deal with the health problems. Some people believe that providing curriculum to deal with problems by providing lesson in curriculum.,"An increasing number of overweight individuals is putting a strain on the health care system in order to mitigate these issue. Certain people argue that providing curriculum in school to deal with the problem. This essay agree that insert lessons in curriculum of school because this suggestion would be benefit people health in general, and it would have a positive impact on the shape of their body.

There is some truth in the argument that providing section of health in curriculum can be helpful students to be more care about their health and they might be fit. However, I think the lessons would be about kind of healthy food and cardio exercies. This is because many food are cause of obesity, but exercies are also the cause. I think, unless people should know about this issue earlr in the school throght the lesson, individual might face heavy problems in the future. This means that, although exist asustance provide energy to the body, there is also a food which contain of alot of fat, which is the main cause of obesity. Moreover, Another reason why I believe that teaching about obesity in curriculum of school is that lake of walking. The majority of individuals are sedentary, for they watch tv for along hours. Thus, people becoming overweight. This is because they don't care about size of the problem, and it is effect. For instance, according to a recent report by the Guardian newspaper shown that in the USA there have been an increase in the amount of adolescent obesity, which was the result of many years. In conclusion, despite there are people who feel that curriculum don't need additional like heath section, I do not agree, as this would be a beneficial step and it could be a healthy community empty from disease.

There are various reasons for the rise in the overweight population which can be addressed and solved to decrease this incidence.

There are many reasons for the increasing obesity, and one of the major cause is, reduction in physical activity. Most of the office jobs offer a sedentary environment with long working hours and people have less time for physical exercise and sports, which leads them to gain weight. Secondly, the food choices have also changed over the years and now most of the people prefer takeaways and fast food over home-cooked or healthy food items, which causes unhealthy weight gain and thus increases the risk of health problems among them.

However, this problem can be solved by taking a few health measures. Firstly, spreading awareness regarding the significance of physical activity and the provision of fitness facilities can significantly reduce the number of the overweight population. Secondly, educating people about healthy food choices and the availability of healthy and nutritious meals in the cafeterias and supermarkets can help us lower the risk of obesity and obesity-related diseases.

Taking brighter side into consideration. There are many advantages of studying abroad. The first key benefit is that student can get admission in world class universities.

The percentage of overweight children in western society has increased by almost 20% in the last ten years. Discuss the causes and effects of this disturbing trend.,"Over the last ten years, western societies have seen close to a 20% rise in the number of children who are overweight. This essay will discuss some reasons why this has occurred and examine the consequences of this worrying trend.

The main cause of this problem is poor diet. Over the last decade there has been a prolific increase in the number of fast food restaurants. For example, on nearly every high street there is a MacDonald’s, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Pizza Hut. The food in these places has been proven to be very unhealthy, and much of the advertising is targeted at children, thus ensuring that they constitute the bulk of the customers of these establishments. However, it is not only due to eating out, but also the type of diet many children have at home. A lot of food consumed is processed food, especially with regards to ready-made meals which are a quick and easy option for parents who are working hard.

The effects of this have been and will continue to be very serious. Firstly, there has been a large increase in health related diseases amongst children, especially diabetes. This debilitating illness means a child has to be injected with insulin for the rest of their life. Not only this, very overweight children often experience bullying from other children, which may affect their mental health. The negative stigma of being overweight may also affect self-esteem.

To sum up, it is evident that there are several causes of obesity amongst children, and a variety of negative effects. Society must ensure steps are taken to prevent this problem from deteriorating further. ",No,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5
The number of people who are at risks of serious health problems due to overweight is increasing. What is the reason for the growth in overweight people in society? How can this problem be solved? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Recent decades have witnessed an enormous growth of the obesity epidemic in many developed countries. There is not the slightest doubt that people`s health status will be seriously threatened by this issue. This essay will illustrate the main factors contributing to obesity problems and thereby elicit some feasible solutions.

Firstly, current research has blamed the increasing overweight population on the ubiquitous junk food. You are what you eat. In order to be fit, one needs to eat healthily. Excessive fat, which is hardly digested has been regarded as the major reason for obesity. Secondly, by spending more time on TV programs and browsing the internet, people have fewer opportunities to participate in sports activities. The accumulated calories would be expended only if one does enough physical exercises. Last but not least, convenient transportation intensifies this situation. Trains and automobiles are the favorable commuting methods of urban citizens. When walking and running are excluded from modern lifestyles, more and more people have to face overweight issues.

Thus a combination of unhealthy food, lack of physical exercise, and modern lifestyle has contributed to the rise in obesity problems amongst people. However, every cloud has a silver lining, governments should take the responsibility to help people escape from the obesity dilemma. To begin, the production and sales of junk foods should be strictly constrained, especially to adolescents. On top of that, public service advertisements about healthy diet and physical exercises should be released through TV channels and various websites. Furthermore, local councils should organize more sports events, pine participants' interests, and provide them with an incentive to do more physical practices such as walking, running, and cycling.

Henceforth, it can be confidently concluded that the growth of obesity has significant relevance to the modern lifestyle. Governments are committed to guiding citizens to a healthy situation because health is wealth. ",No,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5
The growing number of overweight people is putting a strain on the health care system in an effort to deal with the health issues involved. Some people think that the best to deal with this problem is to introduce more physical education lessons in the school curriculum. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The soaring trend of the obese people is a crucial concern for the whole health care system and some people who think for solutions like increasing physical-education related subjects in the schools. The whole train of thoughts in this article totally disagrees with the mentioned solution. I believe that this method will rob youngsters of a prosperous prospect and has no effective impact on current society.

Juveniles need to learn a wide variety of hands-on skills, at which they can excel in their future life, during their education period. This fact involves having a myriad of school disciplines ranging from mathematics to social sciences in their curriculum, which fills a chief proportion of their available time. Focusing on just one part of vital skills such as athletic subjects will undoubtedly result in a generation addicted to sports and will deprive this generation of planning and developing a glorious life.

Although having an active life for adolescents will lead to a physically-active generation, it has no tangible impact on current overweight folks. Thus, I guess that the best initiative for encouraging this part of society to have an energetic life-style instead of a sedentary one is promotion of daily-based work-out benefits, devastating effects of obesity on physical well-being, and the challenges of public health care system pertinent to handling this crisis on the media.

Overall, the health care system will not witness a low workload unless whole society, not just part of it, get informed about the burdens they are imposing on health service, and the fact that with respect to the obesity ""The prevention beats the treatment"". ",No,No,Yes,No,No,No,5.5

Furthermore, individuals are consuming too much junk food which includes the amount of fat, sugar in fact of eating healthy food. There are some solutions which could be implemented to deal with these root causes of obesity. The first way is that the person need to inculate healthy eating habits from childhood, their parents should control meals and ensure that they have a healthy diet.

They discuss about how they will maintain the healthy balance of the children, if they did not so some exercise. Some people believe that schools should give some extra time for sports and exercise to help them loose some weight.

I believe that giving extra curricular for sports and exercise is not enough to decrease a number of overweight children. First most children now, is not interested to play outside because they want to play some online games which is not healthy to them. Parents and teachers should not allow the students to use any gadgets like cellphones, tablets and etc. while they ate still young they should discipline by eating healthy and doing some exercise

Secondly, a healthy body started at the home. Guardians will know how to prepare healthy food for her/his children. they should encourage them to start eating vegetables, fish and some healthy food diet. Eating junk-foods is not necessary to children health, which will cause of some disease, like Urinary tract infection (UTI).

In conclusion, showing to children that eating healthy food and making exercise will encourage them to do the same. Schools in not the one who is responsible for making the children healthy, teachers will help to maintain the healthy balance but parents should teach them to eat and do exercise to become their children healthy.

"Nowadays, much more people find it hard to deal with overweight problem. Several people's opinions that the solution to this issue is to begin new physical events in school. I forcefully oppose this opinion, adding new physical subjects to the school; it is not the solution no matter when.","First, I believe that adding extra physical education to the school curriculum.

Many countries across the world are also willing to welcome more international tourists which there are a lot of facilities to encourage their visitors. For this essay, I will discuss the benefits and drawbacks with regard to international trips which the pros quite significantly outnumber the cons.

Travelling abroad is comfortable to approach than in the past era for many reasons. On the one hand, there are plenty of advantages regarding aboard travelling. First of all, more individuals would like to go abroad for their vacations because it is quite valuable to pay at an affordable price. They could less spend money on their trips due to many travelling promotions, such as air tickets and room services. Secondly, many states around the world have transformed their policies in order to encourage more people to visit their own countries. The easier access is, the more people visit. Furthermore, the public would like to inspire themselves when they go to new places which could be greatly experienced.

On the other hand, some drawbacks could be recognised regarding the international journey. One of the reasons is that it clearly requires more preparation for both documents, passports and some tickets, and many things including more expenditure. For instance, they should look for accommodation in order to stay in the vacation period. Then, it may also require a reservation in advance. So, it means that one needs to pay the money to book before travelling. In addition, they should provide their own materials or personal belongings which are necessary to be applicable when they stay on holidays.

Certainly, in this contemporary era masses became more techie and they use advanced level of technology one of from them is working from home.

Is is better to do unpaid work in their free time is better . Do you think it’s advantage overweight it’s disadvantages,"A few people believe that adolescents must be encouraged to participate in unpaid social service during their free time as it would be beneficial for both teenagers and the society. I disagree with this view and I will defend my stand with valid arguments in this essay.

To begin with, if teenagers are required to volunteer for unpaid community services, some people think that it would enhance their feeling of empathy towards mankind and nature. As teenagers are highly impressionable, working for the community will turn them into socially responsible adults. So, for the benefit of the community and teenagers, teenagers must be encouraged to occupy themselves with voluntary work in their free time.

However, children between thirteen and nineteen years of age are fragile and through community work, they have to dig deep into the harsh realities of life such as hunger and poverty. This could adversely affect their young conscience and they would be carrying the negative image of society in their minds throughout their lives. Also, if the work is unpaid, there is a lack of motivation as well because if they are not paid for their efforts, they may get discouraged to participate in future. For example, many children are devastated when they interact with the deprived segment of the society and sometimes this leads to serious cognitive issues like depression and phobia of meeting new people. Therefore, it should not be mandatory for the teenagers to take part in unpaid social work in their free time. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,5
"Cause and effect essay: A problem of modern societies is the declining level of health, especially gaining weight of the general population. Researchers are warning people with the facts that obesity can bring serious problems such as depression and heart-related diseases. In this essay, we will discuss the possible causes and effects of being overweight.","In my opinion, one of the main reasons why people get obese is eating junk food and a sedentary lifestyle. Nowadays, the number of people who working day and night is constantly increasing, so they do not have any leisure time to cook by themselves. In order to save some time to work, they prefer to order a cheap meal from fast-food restaurants, such as MacDonalds, KFC and etc which after what, they consume more fats, carbohydrates than they would cook by themselves. Because, scientists proved that, if a person cook from natural ingredients, the number of fats will be considerably fewer than in restaurants.

Also, the next reason for this problem is a sedentary lifestyle without any physical activities. Now, people to relax choose sitting in front of the TV instead of doing sport. It has been proved that during the sport, it is so much oxygen carried to the brain, after which you will feel yourself cheerfully. But when we are collapsing near the TV, we burn fewer calories than we consume, as a result, of course, we are starting to gain the pounds.

As the possible effects of this problem, we can consider some health problems and loss of productivity. First of all, obesity results in incorrect functioning of the body and contributes to the risk of developing some chronic diseases. For example, as body fat percentage increases, the person's metabolism worsens, which in turn may result in diabetes or heart diseases.

Secondly, overweight people are very unhealthy and often suffer from stress and tiredness. This lessens their work capacity and results in lower productivity. For example, it has been proven that an obese person needs to put more effort to complete some task than a person with normal weight.

To sum up, obesity is a big problem that affects a lot of people nowadays. It’s mainly caused by inactive lifestyle and eating disorders and results in severe health problems and loss of productivity. ",No,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5
The number of people who are fat and overweight are much higher than previous generations. What are the reasons? What can be done to solve those problems?,"In the modern world, fat and obese individuals are significantly bigger than before. Within the scope of this writing, an attempt will be made to look at the causes for this trend and put forward some solutions.

One of the most serious issues is that individuals do not eat nutritious foods. This means that instead of eating nutritious foods like vegetables, fruit, or fish which contain vitamin C, D, A, and other nutrients, they eat fast food, especially for children. The answer is that parents should teach their children about the negative effects of junk food, such as heart-related diseases

Another cause is that citizens do not routinely take part in outdoor activities. They sleep instead of exercising because they don't have enough time, their work or their children make them tired. Perhaps, young people believe that they are in good health and exercise is a waste of time. In addition, rather than participating in sports, they spend their leisure time playing video games, surfing the internet, Facebook, or watching television. To solve this problem the governments should construct public parks with modern equipment so that inhabitants may exercise and talk together. This not only helps their health to be more adequate but also reduces their stress after work or study.

In conclusion, although eating an unhealthy diet and not participating in outdoor activities regularly are the two problems of this trend, improving the awareness of children by educating them and building public parks with state-of-the-art facilities are the possible ways to address the situation.

"At the present time, the large and number of young adults, compare with the number of older people. Situation overweight the disadvantages situation","As it is seen in a number of countries, the number of old population are lower than the young individuals. This situation has some disadvantages nevertheless and number of benefits. Without any doubt, I completely believe that the advantages overweight the drawbacks.

First of all, the young adults will face a major disadvantage and it is the lack of experience. People gain experience from the mistakes they make and new generations often kam found off problem which are new for them but not for the old people. For instance, there was a earthquake in our area when everyone was panicked, mother and father remained calm and leaded everyone out of their home safely. Experienced person can help Nation from any bad situation where you can easily lost their focus.

Even though the disadvantage is massive, the advantages not less than that. The energy and innovative mentality can help one Nation to prosper and overcome several problems. The old members of society are always try to stick with the traditional way but young do not fear to try something new. For example, the advancement of technology are all thanks to the mentality of youngs. Young people use technology for making life easy which are very visible.

What are the causes and effects of being overweight?,"The recent years are witnessing an alarming growth in the number of overweight people. It is extremely easy to find the main causes and effects this phenomenon has on daily life.

In my opinion, the foremost causes of overweight are inactive lifestyle and unhealthy eating habits. Today more and more people rely on cars instead of walking, have less physical demands at work and prefer inactive leisure activities. This results in burning fewer calories and gaining weight. Secondly, it is undeniable that those who consume fast food gain weight much faster than those who don’t. With the consumption of fried food moving in tandem, fat will accumulate, assemble, and is gradually hard to be got rid of. Thus, an inactive lifestyle and eating fast food are the two most important causes of overweight.

The main effects stemming from these reasons are health-related diseases. Including heart diseases, diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke, and some types of cancer. Those kinds of diseases will certainly make them feel a struggle in their life. For example, the majority of people with diabetes and high blood pressure in Vietnam and other ASEAN countries are considered to be the main influences of overweight. In addition, being overweight also causes the body to become oversized, so it causes feelings of inferiority and stress for overweight people themselves.

To sum up, overweight is a big problem that affects a lot of people nowadays. It’s mainly caused by inactive lifestyle and eating disorders and results in severe health problems and loss of confidence.",No,No,No,No,Yes,No,5.5
the best way to deal with problems related to overweight is by introduce more physical education lessons in the school curriculum,"Due to the increasing number of people who suffer from obesity, most of the health systems around the world are stressed, because of dealing with this issue in addition to another ones, and for this reason, there is a thought that this problem can be solved by introducing more physical subjects for students at schools. In my opinion, education people through specific programs and supporting these by governments is more essential.

In most cases, educating students with lessons related to health is not sufficient alone as they need to be mentored all the time not just at schools. Thus, certain programs can be established for this purpose to educate the people and provide them with the needed physical trainings. Some organizations, for example, can be prepared with experienced trainees and supported with materials to make them ready to help obesity people.

Also, governments play an important role in supporting such programs. One of the supportive things, that could be done, is funding these organizations and training centers. In this way, after a certain period of time, the taken procedures will enhance the community's health, for instance, by removing the burden on the hospitals, which have been occupied with obesity issues.

In conclusion, just teaching the students more subjects to maintain their health is not a good approach as they need an appropriate supervision to guarantee that they have considered what they learnt. For this reason, I believe that the population need to be educated and mentored by specialized persons and the people in the governments could contribute in avoiding problems related to obesity by support and establish the needed programs.

some reasons lead to overweight and malnutrition,"Overweight

I will talk about some reasons that make us overweight. First of all, we consume too much junk food and sweets such as fried chicken, hamburgers or something which are made by chemicals like fish balls, shrimp balls or milk tea. Nowadays, due to the development of food and drinks stores as well as teenager necessaries, the average number of obese people increases quickly. Second, lack of exercise is also a cause of fat accumulation. Almost all teenagers don't like to do exercises because they could study hard and spend their free time on entertainment. They use a lot of weight loss functional medicine instead of doing exercises because it helps us lose weight very fast and easier. However, they underestimate the harmful effects of taking drugs and they rely too much on them. In the past, I used to be overweight due to eating too many sweets. I'm addicted to eating and I must eat a lot to lose weight, but I totally don't do exercise because of laziness, so I gained weight uncontrollably. It's very hard and makes me bored. However, I am always scared of body shaming, so I decided to force myself to change the negative thoughts of everybody.

Malnutrition
Malnutrition is a common condition in some people in society. It comes from a lot of reasons, but I will give you some main reasons that lead to this. First, digestive disorders when they eat anything. This is a disease that makes people poorly absorb foods, or lose their appetite and can't eat much. This leads to a lack of energy and nutrients for the body to function properly. Second, due to low economic conditions, some poor countries such as Central Africa, Nigeria, perhaps face poverty and lack of food every year, so most of the people were malnourished and suffered from severe food poisoning.

"overweight in childern is a problem nowadays, some people claim that government have to take full responsibility for this problem. in what extent do you agree or not agree?","In recent years, obesity has become increasingly / one of the most serious health problems among people of all ages, especially children. While some people claim that the government should take full responsibility to find the solution for this problem, there are those who believe that parents and shools also play an important role in dealing with the issue and I also agree with this.

On the one hand, there are several solutions on this problem that the authority should consider. First, the government may have some advertise campaigns about the negative effects of obesity to raise the public’s awareness. By this way, people will be encouraged to have an active, healthy lifestyle. Second, advertisements on foods and drinks that contain high sugars and fat should be restricted on TV and other mass media.

On the other hand, parents and school are also responsible for maintaining low level of overweight among their children. One of the main causes of obesity and unhealthy in children is the choice of daily diet by their parents. A healthy nutritional balanced diet is necessary for every single child to grow up normally without any serious diseases. In addition, as the lack of physical exercises can also lead to an obese child, an amount of physical sessions should be held weekly by schools for their young students to keep fit and stay healthy.

In conclusion, childhood obesity has become a rising issue in modern society, but I strongly believe that it can still be controlled if the government, parents and schools get together to help our young generation. ",No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,6
"What cause an increasing in the number of overweight children, and how to solve","The number of children that are overweight which could occur various issues regarding to both of the children's health and the health care expenses in future to come. In my opinion, children gain weight by having only unproductive things for exants, Candies, ice-cream including junk foods. In order to fill the bill, parent or guardian should keep an eye on children and limit the amount of junk food that kids taken in daily life.

In my way of thinking children these days have eaten a great amount of junk food that contains a number of carbohydrates and fats, moreover, they don't exercise enough to burn calories. Nowadays, parents spoiled their kids by let them have what they want.

Moreover, guardians are not concerns about future health expenses

that their children will be responsible for.

Nevertheless, as being a parent, parent should has their own way in order to deal with your kids since children are too young to consider what is good or bad by themselves. As school plays an important role in children's life,

school and teachers must keep in touch with students with the purpose of limiting carbohydrates taken in certain meals.

In addition, schools should provide daily exercise for students to lose weights and also contribute a healthy diet lesson to students.

Ultimately, In order for children to lose weight, they need parents or guardians to help them accomplished a goal by monitoring their own kids and making sure that they will not face both health and healthcare costs in a few years to come. ",No,No,No,No,No,No,5.5
